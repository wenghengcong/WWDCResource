00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:21,054
>>>TIM COOK:
Good morning!


2
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,290
Good morning!


3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,857
Good morning.


4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,728
Good morning.


5
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,431
Good morning!


6
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:35,869
Thanks for joining us.


7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,537
And welcome to San Francisco.


8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,541
Welcome to WWDC 2015.


9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,611
Although we may not
have any -- thank you --


10
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,415
high-flying trapeze acts, we
do have a lot of great things


11
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,417
to talk about this morning.


12
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,754
This developer conference
continues to be the epicenter


13
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:58,825
of change for not only
Apple, but the industry.


14
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,195
This is our 26th WWDC.


15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,799
We have attendees today
from over 70 countries,


16
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,369
and 80 percent are here
for the very first time.


17
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:14,908
[Applause]


18
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:19,146
This is our most
global conference ever.


19
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:24,384
And a special shout-out for
our 350 scholarship winners.


20
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:31,858
[Cheers and applause]


21
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,827
These guys are unbelievable.


22
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,429
I spent some time
with them yesterday.


23
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,299
Our youngest scholarship
winner is a 12-year-old girl


24
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,434
from New York.


25
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,904
She is going to have a
fantastic future ahead.


26
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,906
[Applause]


27
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,408
We've got over a hundred
sessions planned for you


28
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,411
and over 150 labs so that
you can get your hands


29
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,047
on our latest technologies.


30
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,617
And we've got over a thousand
Apple engineers to answer just


31
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,721
about any question
that you might have.


32
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,589
Now, we've got a lot more
people that would have liked


33
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,891
to have been here this
morning, but unfortunately,


34
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,794
we just can't fit any
more in, as you can tell.


35
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,697
And so for the first time,


36
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,467
we're not only live
streaming the Keynote,


37
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,869
but we are live streaming
30 sessions


38
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,438
of the conference as well.


39
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:24,311
[Applause]


40
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,647
Now, before we get right to
the show, I'd like to bring


41
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,418
up something that I saw on
the news just a few days ago.


42
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,720
This is Brandon Moss of
the Cleveland Indians,


43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,692
and he hit his 100th career
home run last Tuesday.


44
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,827
Obviously, it's a huge milestone
if you are a baseball player.


45
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,096
Not a lot of people do this.


46
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,098
And you can imagine how much


47
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,235
that ball would mean
to him to have it.


48
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:52,606
It turns out the ball was hit
into the Indians' bull pen,


49
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:57,044
and his teammates decided to
play a bit of a prank on him.


50
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:01,014
They decided to hold
it for ransom.


51
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,785
And this is the list of
things they asked for.


52
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:10,290
[Laughter] Apple Watches,
iPads, MacBook Airs, iPhones.


53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,358
It's unbelievable.


54
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,493
It's a shopping list
for the Apple Store.


55
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:19,633
[Applause]


56
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,602
Now, Brandon would have
had to raid an Apple Store


57
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,204
to get that ball back.


58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,075
That didn't seem quite right
to us, and so what we're going


59
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,344
to do is we're going
to pay the ransom.


60
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:37,517
And I have the ball right here.


61
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:45,525
[Applause]


62
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,296
We are giving the ball to
Brandon, and we are going


63
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,666
to give everything his
teammates asked for to them


64
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,534
so everybody is happy.


65
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,604
So congratulations, Brandon,
on a hundred home runs,


66
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,539
and good luck on
the next hundred.


67
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:04,778
[Applause]


68
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,314
Now, we've got a
jam-packed morning for you.


69
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,316
We are going to get
started with OS X.


70
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,984
We are bringing a whole bunch


71
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,287
of new great capabilities
to the Macintosh.


72
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,091
And next we've got a
great update for iOS,


73
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,495
the world's most advanced
mobile operating system.


74
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,799
And today we're bringing
native apps


75
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,568
to the Watch with a new version.


76
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:33,206
[Applause]


77
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,309
With a new version
of the watchOS,


78
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,280
which gives the developers
even more time


79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,650
to create even greater
apps for the Watch


80
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,919
that will change the world.


81
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,589
Now, all three of these
ecosystems together provide


82
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,026
incredible opportunities
for developers


83
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,830
and unbelievable
possibilities for users.


84
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,832
So we are very excited
about this.


85
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,334
There's a lot here, and
so I am going to dispense


86
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,503
with my normal updates other


87
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,106
than to tell you
everything's going great.


88
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,108
[Laughter]


89
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:12,078
[Applause]


90
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,580
And I'd like to bring
out my friend


91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,551
and colleague Craig Federighi to
take you through OS X and iOS.


92
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,219
Craig.


93
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,823
[Applause]


94
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,158
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Good morning!


95
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,167
It's fantastic to be
with you here at WWDC.


96
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,270
The team has been doing
some amazing work this year,


97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,440
and I am thrilled to be able
to share it with you today.


98
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,510
We are going to start with OS X.


99
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,080
Now, our current release,
Yosemite, is a big, bold,


100
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,650
beautiful release
with a gorgeous new UI


101
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,820
and breakthrough features like
Continuity that let you work


102
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,190
across your devices
like never before.


103
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,261
Now, the adoption rate for
Yosemite is just incredible.


104
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,997
In fact, over 55 percent


105
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,800
of active Mac users are
running our latest update,


106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,238
and this is just unprecedented
in the history of our industry.


107
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:15,909
[Laughter] In fact, Yosemite
has the fastest adoption rate


108
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,245
for any PC operating
system ever.


109
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,679
So thank you.


110
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:26,152
[Applause]


111
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,856
So for our next big release of
OS X, we knew we wanted to build


112
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,158
on those strengths of Yosemite


113
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,362
with some really great
refinements and advances.


114
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:39,799
The only real question, of
course, was what to call it.


115
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:45,639
So we had to once again turn to
our crack Apple Marketing Team.


116
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,342
Now, in typical California
fashion, they started


117
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,211
with a project kickoff meeting.


118
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,013
[Laughter]


119
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,483
And then headed immediately
into a team building off site.


120
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,752
[Laughter]


121
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,254
Now, of course they are in their
traditional Apple Marketing


122
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,657
Free-Bottom Fridays attire.


123
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,659
They say it's all
part of their process.


124
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,761
I am not sure I get it.


125
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,164
Ultimately, this
didn't yield any names,


126
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,266
so they called in a consultant.


127
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,268
[Laughter]


128
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,639
He told them the answer
was to be found within.


129
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,643
Not within themselves,
but within Yosemite.


130
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:29,749
And so the new name for
OS X is OS X El Capitan.


131
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:38,825
[Applause]


132
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,761
For El Capitan, we focused
in two major areas --


133
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,297
experience and performance.


134
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,435
For experience, we've made
Spotlight more expressive,


135
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,805
more powerful, and more
knowledgeable than ever.


136
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,442
We've made big enhancements
to the apps you use most,


137
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,478
and we made some real great
advancements in the area


138
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,947
of how you manage
windows on the system.


139
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,883
But rather than just talk about
it, I'd like to show it to you,


140
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,786
so let's start with
a demo right now.


141
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:11,424
[Applause]


142
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,094
Now, your first task, of
course, in a demonstration


143
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,097
or whenever you wake your
Mac, is finding the cursor,


144
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,932
and El Capitan makes
this easier than ever.


145
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,835
I just do that little
shake we all normally do,


146
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,669
and there it is.


147
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,603
It comes right out to greet you.


148
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,804
It's really handy.


149
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,975
[Applause]


150
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,010
Now, we brought other great
gestures to the system.


151
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,212
I am just going to
go here in Mail.


152
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,414
I have a message here from Eddy.


153
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:38,284
Looks like -- well, now --
[Laughter] -- that's a keeper.


154
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,520
So I can actually mark
it unread to keep it just


155
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,358
by swiping two fingers across
the trackpad just like that.


156
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,428
And this one I'd kind of like
to delete, so I am just going


157
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,096
to swipe it away just like that.


158
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,132
So some real nice
little gestures.


159
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,267
Let's move on now to Safari.


160
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,303
Now, in Safari, I have some
sites that I like to keep


161
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,073
around because I refer to them
on and off throughout the day,


162
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:05,945
and now in Safari, I can pin
those sites just like this.


163
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,982
So there's -- I am going to
pin my Twitter site here.


164
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,284
And of course I have been
following the Warriors.


165
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,353
Go Warriors, we are
going to get it done.


166
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,355
[Applause]


167
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,556
Just like that.


168
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,092
Now, Pinned Sites have a
lot of special properties.


169
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,562
For one, if I close this
window and reopen it,


170
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,098
you see that my Pinned
Sites are all right there,


171
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,999
and they load instantly.


172
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,736
Now, Pinned Sites also behave
differently when I follow links,


173
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,304
so I am just going
to click on one here,


174
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,542
and you notice it opens in a new
tab, but my pinned site remains.


175
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,911
Now I am going to open
up a couple more links.


176
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,547
This one, let's see, this one.


177
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,048
I will take a quick look.


178
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,284
This one looks like some
kind of presentation video.


179
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,518
This one is about the Giants.


180
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,920
Have you ever had
this happen to you?


181
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,256
You are like, Where is
this audio coming from?


182
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,294
Now with just a tap,
you can mute it or find


183
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:58,898
out where it came from and
shut it down just like that.


184
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:03,770
[Applause]


185
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,873
So I am interested in
seeing this Giants game,


186
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,908
and now Spotlight can
actually help me out there.


187
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,744
So I am just going to do a
search for the SF Giants,


188
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,948
and we see right now I
get current game scores,


189
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,249
upcoming games.


190
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,518
Looks like the game I want
to go to is on Friday,


191
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,955
so I can just search
for weather on Friday.


192
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,289
See we get the weather.


193
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:28,795
We can even resize the Spotlight
panel and move it around.


194
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,899
I mean, there's innovation; huh?


195
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,735
[Laughter] But I can also
express myself in my own words


196
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,205
in Spotlight searches now, so
I can do things like slides


197
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,274
from Brian, and you
see I find those there.


198
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,278
But how about slides from
Brian about El Capitan?


199
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,715
You see, I find exactly what I
am looking for in my own words.


200
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,950
Now, this works great
in other apps as well.


201
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,585
Let's try it out in Mail.


202
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,421
So I've been really busy, of
course, the last couple of days,


203
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,190
so I have been getting a
little behind on my Mail.


204
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,393
I want to see the messages
that I've received from Phil


205
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,828
but that I haven't
responded to yet.


206
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:08,268
So I am just going to say
"mail I ignored from Phil."


207
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,671
[Laughter] There are a few,
but I will be getting back


208
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,108
to him right after the show.


209
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:19,712
[Laughter] So next, of course,
it's great in the Finder


210
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,049
as well, so if I wanted to look
at documents that I was working


211
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,586
on last year at this time,
I might say something like


212
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:31,858
"documents I worked
on last June."


213
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,626
And I find exactly
what I am looking for.


214
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,296
So this is really a
great way to search.


215
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,798
Next I want to turn to window
management, so I am just going


216
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,934
to run a script here that's
going to open up a whole bunch


217
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,436
of windows to simulate kind
of what my desktop looks


218
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,639
like after a day working on OS
X because it's a powerful system


219
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,207
and we tend to have
a lot of things open.


220
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,245
OS X provides some great ways
to navigate your windows,


221
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,580
and one of those
is Mission Control.


222
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,951
In El Capitan, we made
Mission Control smoother,


223
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,485
simpler, and faster than ever.


224
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,388
I am going to take three fingers
and swipe up on the trackpad.


225
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,124
We get this gorgeous
overview of Mission Control.


226
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,659
I'll just bring forward Safari.


227
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,262
Let's do that again
and bring up Mail.


228
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,063
Just like that.


229
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,264
Works really great.


230
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,399
Of course, OS X provides
great tools also


231
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,768
to organize your windows, and
one of those is Full Screen.


232
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,104
I am going to take this
window here full screen,


233
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,039
and I am going to reply.


234
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,775
Looks like there's a
message here from Eddy.


235
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,379
He says sorry about bailing
on the team dinner last night.


236
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,716
He was apparently
prepping for the Keynote.


237
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,150
So that's understandable.


238
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,221
But it looks like, actually,
I just got a new mail


239
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,025
from Jeff here, and now I can
just click away, and it hides,


240
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,894
and then -- oh, hold on.


241
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,296
Busted, Eddy.


242
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,331
So I think I'll just
drag this, actually,


243
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,568
right into my Compose window,
it hops up automatically,


244
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,702
and I can do it just like that.


245
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,070
It's really great.


246
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,175
And I can even open up
tabs in Compose as well.


247
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,543
It's really handy.


248
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:02,081
So this is a great way now to
work in full screen in Mail.


249
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:08,087
[Applause]


250
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,355
Thank you.


251
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,823
Now, we've done something
totally new to El Capitan,


252
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,192
and it's the ability
to work really easily


253
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,927
on two windows side by side.


254
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,064
So I am just going to click and
hold here on the green button.


255
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,768
And you see it's
prompting me to pick a side.


256
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,036
I will just drop it in.


257
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,038
And you notice I get an expose
of all my other windows.


258
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,107
Let me pick the new News
app, just like that.


259
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:33,980
[Applause]


260
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,948
Of course, I can
resize this window


261
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,483
to style it just the way I want.


262
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,418
How about that blur?


263
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,586
Again, innovation.


264
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,389
[Laughter] So, great
way to work.


265
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,124
Here I can drag links,
for instance,


266
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,760
from Safari right in here.


267
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,064
You notice in the new Notes app,
I get a beautiful graphical link


268
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,265
that gives me a nice thumbnail


269
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,535
that helps me identify
what I dragged in there.


270
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,738
I am going to drag
in some yurts.


271
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,173
I think yurts, first
time mentioned


272
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,375
on the WWDC Keynote stage.


273
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,543
There you go.


274
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,677
Got some yurts here.


275
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,581
Great way to work split screen.


276
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,651
We've also provided a really
easy way to move windows


277
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,252
into their own desktops.


278
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,655
So let me just take this window
here, I'm just going to drag it


279
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,492
up past the top of the screen,
and drop it in just like that.


280
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:23,162
So easy. I can also do this
to take a window full screen.


281
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,932
So let's take Photos, just
drop it in right here,


282
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,533
I took it full screen.


283
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,701
Check this out.


284
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,205
I am going to take
Messages, drop it on Photos,


285
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,874
and create a split
view just like that.


286
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,176
Totally awesome.


287
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,613
[Applause]


288
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,515
And that is a quick look
at some improvements


289
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:46,185
to the experience in El Capitan.


290
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:50,990
[Applause]


291
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,893
So we saw in El Capitan
a powerful form of search


292
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,729
in Spotlight that lets
you compose your searches


293
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,898
in your own words.


294
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,233
It knows more than ever,


295
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,403
can look up weather,
stocks, game scores.


296
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:09,408
We saw gestures, for instance,
just swiping to delete in Mail.


297
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,711
And, of course, pin
sites in Safari


298
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,881
and the ability to
easily mute tabs.


299
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,617
A great new Notes app that
supports text styling,


300
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,720
checklists, and graphical links.


301
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,688
And better window
management than ever


302
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,759
with a beautiful new
Mission Control interface,


303
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,962
easy access to your
spaces bar, and of course,


304
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,666
the ability to do split
view and adjust it


305
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,234
to see exactly what
you are looking for,


306
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,371
every pixel of your display
devoted to your content.


307
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,574
Of course, there's much more
to experience in El Capitan,


308
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:45,378
but now I want to
turn to performance.


309
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,615
So we've optimized performance
throughout the system.


310
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,519
In fact, we are seeing about
a 1.4 times acceleration


311
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,522
in app launching,
a 2x improvement


312
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,292
in the snappiness
of switching apps.


313
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,062
The time to get first Mail
messages, twice as fast.


314
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,265
Opening a PDF in preview,
four times as fast.


315
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,102
But we've also made deep
architectural improvements,


316
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,272
and that brings us to Metal.


317
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,175
[Applause]


318
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,310
Thank you.


319
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,046
Last year we introduced
Metal at WWDC as a way


320
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,683
to accelerate graphics in
high-performance games.


321
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,219
It takes the overhead
out of OpenGL,


322
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,120
providing a high-performance API


323
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,423
that gives the game
direct access to the power


324
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,425
of the underlying
graphics hardware.


325
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,028
Well, this year we are
bringing Metal to the Mac.


326
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,397
And we are doing more than that.


327
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,567
Because we are taking the
graphic stacks on which apps


328
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,470
on OS X are built, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,


329
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,908
and moving them from OpenGL to
run natively on top of Metal,


330
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,810
making everything you do faster.


331
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,145
We are seeing 50
percent improvements


332
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,482
in rendering performance
and a 40 percent reduction


333
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,118
in the amount of CPU
necessary to do graphics.


334
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,654
That means improved performance
for your applications


335
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,489
and better battery life.


336
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,791
But the benefits of
Metal don't stop there.


337
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,463
Metal's also great for
high-performance apps.


338
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:14,500
In fact, Metal combines
the compute power of OpenCL


339
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,968
and the graphics power of OpenGL


340
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:21,007
in a higher performance
API that does both.


341
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,340
And what we've seen from working


342
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,078
with early pro developers
is really phenomenal.


343
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,314
Adobe came in and,
in short order,


344
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:31,684
was able to deliver an
eight times improvement


345
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:35,054
in their rendering effects
inside of After Effects,


346
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,990
and they have been able
to take the drawing engine


347
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,594
in Illustrator, move it on top
of Metal, and take kinds of UI


348
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,797
that previously was
noninteractive,


349
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,700
like zoom of extremely
detailed drawings,


350
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,669
and make it completely flawless


351
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,271
and interactive,
thanks to Metal.


352
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,707
Adobe is so pleased with this
they said they are committed


353
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,243
to adopting Metal
on their OS X apps,


354
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,612
seeing performance
increases up to 8x.


355
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,580
They are excited
about what it can do


356
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,749
for their Creative Cloud users.


357
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,953
Of course, Metal is
also fantastic for games


358
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,821
with a 10x improvement.


359
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,693
That's ten times improvement
in drawing performance.


360
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,563
So we brought in Epic to
see what they could do


361
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,433
in short order, and the
results are really phenomenal.


362
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,269
I'd like to welcome to
the stage Josh Adams


363
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,305
and Billy Bramer
for a quick demo.


364
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,674
[Applause]


365
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,110
>> Thank you,
Craig.


366
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,913
Thank you very much for
having us here today.


367
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,683
So last year Metal
revolutionized graphics on iOS,


368
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:42,288
and now Apple's amazed us again
by bringing Metal to the Mac.


369
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,024
Of course, this is
great news for games,


370
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:48,694
but also for the tools that
we use to make those games.


371
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,864
Here you are seeing Epic's
upcoming multiplayer title


372
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,066
Fortnite, running
entirely on Metal.


373
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,236
We are modifying it directly
within the Unreal Engine,


374
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,673
a development tool that powers
many of today's best games.


375
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,541
It's quite a bit going
on in this scene, though,


376
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,410
so let's break it down.


377
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,013
First, there are
64 different layers


378
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,616
of rendering effects,
and that's a lot.


379
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,051
All combining together, though,


380
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,487
to produce what you
see on the scene today.


381
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,557
If we go into a simple wireframe
mode, you can see the thousands


382
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,793
of building blocks that
make up this world.


383
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:25,031
We can start to add in layers,
flat shading, detailed lighting,


384
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,434
runtime shadows, and finally
we combine them all together


385
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,103
to bring Fortnite's fun and
lighthearted aesthetic to life.


386
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,506
The interesting thing
here, though,


387
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,741
is that all of the effects
you are seeing are being done


388
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,510
completely in real-time.


389
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,812
Notice how the shadows and
objects interact nicely


390
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,014
as Josh moves the car around.


391
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,384
Finally, we can change the
time of day on the fly,


392
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,687
dramatically altering the
mood of the entire scene.


393
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,590
All of this is thanks to
the efficiency of Metal.


394
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,760
In fact, we are seeing
a 70 percent reduction


395
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,297
in CPUs compared to OpenGL,
enabling developers like us


396
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,633
to create richer 3D worlds.


397
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:05,337
Speaking of those worlds, let's
hop into the game, Fortnite.


398
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,139
Now, if you've ever
built a pillow fort


399
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,442
and battled imaginary
monsters with your friends,


400
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,210
you already know how
to play Fortnite.


401
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,245
This is the end-of-the-world
scenario you have been training


402
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,281
for since you were a kid.


403
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,750
It's a beautifully
stylized universe.


404
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,052
You can destroy anything
you want.


405
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,954
Gather resources
and build a fort.


406
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,124
So let's go ahead
and wreck this car.


407
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,260
Gather its metal.


408
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,763
And continue our wanton
destruction by chopping


409
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,565
down this tree to get
some wood for later.


410
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:37,169
Did we mention there
are purple death storms,


411
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,904
like this one, for instance?


412
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,272
We should go.


413
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,775
Luckily, while we were out
exploring, we found a multitude


414
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,878
of weapons, and this broom.


415
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,081
If we can just get
across the field,


416
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,686
our friend has been busy
building a fort across the --


417
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,387
did we mention the storms
are made of monsters?


418
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,725
We are going to need something
a bit better than this broom.


419
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,996
Nice! There's our friend
laying down some covering fire.


420
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,733
>> Hey,
look out!


421
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,303
>> We call that move
the power cord.


422
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,507
I've got a bad feeling
about this.


423
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,643
You are going to
need a bigger fort.


424
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,246
Place a trap, head inside.


425
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,150
Looks like an enemy has
broken into our fort.


426
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,153
All right.


427
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,289
Let's use that wood we gathered
earlier to fix this wall,


428
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,593
build some stairs, meet up
with our friend topside.


429
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:42,668
>> Glad you could
make it.


430
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,803
[Monster screaming]


431
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,139
>> Whether you are a
gamer or a game developer,


432
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,743
Metal opens new possibilities
for rich and engaging worlds.


433
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,279
You can download the Unreal
Engine for Mac right now,


434
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,515
and the Fortnite beta
for Mac starts this fall.


435
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,583
Thank you very much.


436
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:03,122
[Cheers and applause]


437
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,657
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, guys.


438
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,993
That was great.


439
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,962
We have been totally impressed
with what Epic has been able


440
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,031
to accomplish in
such a short time.


441
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,601
And this is in part because the
work they did to adopt Metal


442
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:19,271
in their rendering engines for
iOS immediately pays dividends


443
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:22,641
on OS X, and we are seeing
this with many other developers


444
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,811
as well who are bringing their
gaming engines immediately


445
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,213
to the Mac.


446
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:30,216
And pro app makers are seeing
the benefits of Metal as well,


447
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,651
people like The Foundry
and Autodesk.


448
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,187
I think we are going to
see pro users, gamers,


449
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,989
and all of us benefiting


450
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,658
from the performance
advantages of Metal.


451
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,095
So that is El Capitan,
improvements


452
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,265
to experience and performance.


453
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:51,670
Now, El Capitan is available
to all of you developers today.


454
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,176
[Applause]


455
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:01,113
We will be doing a public
beta once again in July,


456
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,349
and we will be rolling
out to everyone


457
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,085
with a free upgrade this fall.


458
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,688
And that's our update on OS X.


459
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:16,629
[Applause]


460
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,031
Next -- you guessed it -- iOS.


461
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:22,735
Now, our current big
release of iOS is iOS 8,


462
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,605
and iOS 8 was a huge release
with tons of new features


463
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,608
for users and a phenomenal
set of technologies


464
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,810
that you developers
have been able to use


465
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,214
to deliver all-new
experiences to the platform.


466
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,651
The upgrade rate for
iOS has been fantastic.


467
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:42,388
We have 83 percent of active
iPhone users currently running


468
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,822
the latest OS.


469
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,190
And this is really important


470
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,826
because it means not only are
they getting the most recent


471
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,964
features, but they're also up to
date on all the security fixes,


472
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,433
and you're able to
know as a developer


473
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,568
that you can target
all the users


474
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,438
with the latest and
greatest APIs.


475
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,572
And this is a benefit


476
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,743
that actually remains
really unique to iOS.


477
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:10,482
[Applause]


478
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:14,253
So we are now looking forward
to iOS 9, and as we conceived


479
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,556
of what we wanted to
accomplish, first and foremost,


480
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:21,327
we wanted to elevate the
foundations of the platform,


481
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,595
things like extending
your battery life,


482
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,232
improving performance,
and enhancing security


483
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,567
to protect customer data.


484
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,471
But there was more
we wanted to do.


485
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,741
Adding intelligence throughout
the user experience in a way


486
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,344
that enhances how
you use your device


487
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,347
but without compromising
your privacy.


488
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:45,117
Things like improving the
apps that you use most


489
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:49,755
and taking the experience of
the iPad to the next level.


490
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,992
I want to start today with
intelligence and Siri.


491
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,563
Now, Siri has quietly
become incredibly popular.


492
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:01,033
It serves over a billion
requests per week.


493
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,736
And this is in part because
Siri has gotten so great


494
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,070
at understanding
what we are saying.


495
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,741
In just the last year, we've
seen a 40 percent reduction


496
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,478
in word error rate,
down to 5 percent.


497
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,980
That's an industry
leading number.


498
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,249
And Siri is 40 percent
faster than ever


499
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,386
at responding to what we say.


500
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:24,723
Now, for iOS 9, Siri has a
beautiful new UI and is capable


501
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,759
of doing so much more.


502
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,427
Things like "show me photos


503
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:32,998
from Utah last August" can
instantly show you the right


504
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,367
photos from your photo library.


505
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,837
And Siri's really great
at taking reminders.


506
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,206
Now you can ask Siri
things like "remind me


507
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,676
to grab my coffee off the
roof of my car when I get in."


508
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,780
Because Siri knows now when
you've gotten in the car.


509
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,115
And of course, we often want
to take reminders about things


510
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,551
that we are looking at on our
device, some content inside


511
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,586
of our app, maybe a Safari.


512
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,856
Now you can say things
like "remind me about this


513
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,560
when I get home," and that
reminder refers right back


514
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,695
with a link to specifically
what you were looking


515
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,331
at when you took that reminder.


516
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,801
So Siri is a great assistant.


517
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:12,304
But the best assistants
are proactive.


518
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,874
And so on iOS 9, we are
bringing proactivity throughout


519
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,443
the system.


520
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,345
So say you like to run in
the morning, and when you do,


521
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,214
you like to listen to music.


522
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,516
Well, now your phone can
learn that about you,


523
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,485
and when you plug
in your headphones,


524
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,121
can offer up Now Playing
automatically right


525
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,889
on the Lock screen.


526
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,828
[Applause]


527
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,764
And this is all
context-sensitive to the time,


528
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,033
the place, and even the
devices you are connected to,


529
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,069
so you do the same thing in the
car later on, and it might offer


530
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,373
up the audio book that you
have been listening to.


531
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,275
Now, as a great assistant,


532
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,312
your iPhone can now take
invitations you receive


533
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,681
in your email and without you
even touching them automatically


534
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,851
put them on your calendar
and even give you a time


535
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,053
to leave reminder, taking


536
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,189
into account current traffic
conditions, and of course,


537
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,460
with just a swipe, give you
access to driving directions.


538
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,898
Now, have you ever had this
happen to you, you get a call,


539
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,199
the number looks
kind of familiar,


540
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,034
but you are really
not sure who it is?


541
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,104
As a great assistant, your
phone can now look in your email


542
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,674
and find out who that person
might be and suggest it


543
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,743
to you right on the
Incoming Call screen.


544
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,944
It's super handy.


545
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:31,483
[Applause]


546
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,420
Now, this kind of
proactivity is also great


547
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,889
when it comes to Search.


548
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,857
So now when you swipe to the
left of the Home screen to get


549
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,928
to Search, you see that Siri
offers great suggestions,


550
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,864
things like the people that you
might want to contact now based


551
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,700
on your upcoming meetings and
your communication patterns,


552
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,070
the apps that you might want
to launch based, for instance,


553
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,139
on what you just downloaded
from the App Store and haven't


554
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,109
yet tried out, or apps you
tend to use this time of day,


555
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,513
and also easy one-tap
links to locations


556
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,416
that are relevant nearby,
and even breaking news.


557
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:09,488
When it comes to Search, we
also know more than ever before.


558
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:13,325
So for instance, you can
search for sports scores.


559
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,928
And we now support video
search, of popular video sites


560
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:19,831
like Vivi, Vimeo, YouTube,
and the iTunes Store.


561
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,534
And we have these
great descriptive cards


562
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,103
with a Play button so
you can play directly


563
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,905
from your search result.


564
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:32,010
Most importantly, we now
have an API for Search.


565
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:39,084
[Applause]


566
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,219
So now when a user
performs a search,


567
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,590
we can find content behind
the apps they have installed


568
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,061
on the device and pull those up
in Results, and when they tap,


569
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,065
they are deep-linked
directly into the application.


570
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,968
You see for instance
here Airbnb.


571
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,403
They can get their result.


572
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,472
Of course, we even provide
a convenient backlink


573
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,508
so they can get right back
to their search results.


574
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,612
So we think these kinds


575
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:10,215
of intelligence features
really make a huge difference


576
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,249
in your experience in iOS.


577
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,285
And to show you how, I would


578
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,853
like to give you
a quick demo now.


579
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:22,461
So I want to take you through
a day in the life with iOS 9,


580
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:28,800
and we are going to start with
a typical day for me today.


581
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,403
We are going to start
in my bedroom


582
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,205
when I woke up in the morning.


583
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,475
You will notice because my phone
knows that in the morning I


584
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:40,746
like to meditate that it's
offered me a meditation app


585
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,148
right here in the bottom
left of the screen.


586
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,883
So I can just swipe up
from the bottom left,


587
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:49,021
and I am taken right
in to meditate.


588
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,456
Ah, this is so serene.


589
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,761
Well, it looks like I got
a message here from Phil.


590
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:59,097
So Phil says that he is
putting together the invite


591
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,467
for tonight's big karaoke
potluck, and can I still pick


592
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,404
up this super awesome
karaoke machine?


593
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,906
Well, you know, Siri actually,
when I take reminders,


594
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,275
is able to link me right back
to what I am looking for,


595
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,411
so if I want to remember to pick
this up, I can just say this


596
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:16,415
to Siri: "Remind me
about this later today."


597
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:22,320
And so Siri will put
together a reminder,


598
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,958
and you see the link right
back to what I am looking for.


599
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,261
Well, I think after all,
meditation isn't probably


600
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,798
for me, so maybe I'll
move on to exercise.


601
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,836
So I head into the home gym
here, and because my phone knows


602
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,605
that when I am in the home gym
and I hook up headphones and I


603
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,108
like to listen to music,
watch what happens when I plug


604
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,912
in the cord of my headphones.


605
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:49,981
Jumps right in and offers
me some energetic music.


606
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,216
So let's all bust a move.


607
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,852
I don't know what kind


608
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,122
of exercise we are all
doing here, but pretty good.


609
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,224
Looks like actually
I've got that invitation


610
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,259
that Phil was going to send me.


611
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,995
Now, normally I would have
to actually go into Mail,


612
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,832
look at the time, put this
on my Calendar, but in fact,


613
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,734
my phone has automatically
done that for me.


614
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,570
Let me just swipe down here
into Notifications Center,


615
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,272
and we will look at my
calendar for the day.


616
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:18,477
You notice it automatically has
already been added right there.


617
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,045
Now, if we look at
the rest of my day,


618
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,047
ahead I have my vocal warm-ups


619
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,584
for the karaoke performance,
then WWDC.


620
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:29,254
It looks like I have
a little bit of time


621
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,323
to prepare my dish
for the big potluck.


622
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,226
So I am going to head
into the kitchen now,


623
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,894
and let's just swipe in.


624
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,596
When I am looking for
recipes, for instance,


625
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,530
I like to go into Search.


626
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,732
Let's just swipe
over into Search.


627
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,436
We see Siri has actually already
-- before I typed a character --


628
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,239
made suggestions for me
for people I could contact,


629
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,142
for instance, like Trent
Reznor, my vocal coach.


630
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,344
[Laughter] So I can just tap.


631
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,412
Here I can call Trent up,
and he can help me tap


632
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,915
into my inner pain and
rage that allows me


633
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,450
to fuel my vocal performances.


634
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,552
I actually haven't been
able to find the pain


635
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,687
and rage, truth be told.


636
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,590
Also, we have all these
great apps I can run


637
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,927
and locations nearby -- for
instance, because it's morning,


638
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,429
you see coffee and tea and
breakfast places are suggested.


639
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,098
As well as news.


640
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,133
But in this case, I
actually want to do a search.


641
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,169
So I have some potatoes
I think I could make use


642
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,336
of in this recipe.


643
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,305
So let's just search for potato.


644
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,175
Here you notice I am
getting search results right


645
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,576
from Yummly.


646
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,013
Let me tap into Yummly, and you
see I am deep-linked directly


647
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,383
in, so I get the great view
provided by that application.


648
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,585
Now, potato chips aren't
exactly what I am looking for,


649
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,187
so I am going to hit
the Back link here,


650
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,688
and I can browse directly


651
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,258
in to another result,
Canadian Poutine.


652
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,195
That looks exactly like
what the doctor ordered.


653
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,997
Yes. Let's look at
the ingredients.


654
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:49,067
Looks like 6 tablespoons
of unsalted butter.


655
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,202
I am down with that.


656
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,738
I am going to make at
least a double batch.


657
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:58,710
So I can just use Search to do
a conversion of tablespoons,


658
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,945
figure out how much that is.


659
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,514
So that actually
is 3/4 of a cup.


660
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,783
I am going to round
up to an even quart


661
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:09,120
and make myself some
fine poutine.


662
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,623
[Laughter] So Search
is really handy,


663
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,292
but Siri is also
great at search.


664
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,494
So I want to jump
forward to later today.


665
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,799
When I think I will be
reminiscing about WWDC's past.


666
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,269
I can ask Siri to
help me with that.


667
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:30,141
Show my photos from last
June in San Francisco.


668
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:34,246
Oh, yeah, this is great,
all these photos from WWDC.


669
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:37,315
You notice now Photos in iOS
9 has this great scrubber bar


670
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,351
at the bottom, so
I can easily slide


671
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,354
through photos super
quickly, just like this.


672
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,857
Oh, boy, now we are
into the karaoke night.


673
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,359
This is some fine stuff.


674
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,795
Phil really does an
awesome Viking crooner.


675
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,796
This is good stuff.


676
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,166
But of course, the
king of karaoke --


677
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,534
[Laughter] -- Eddy Cue.


678
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,703
In fact, when I want to get
really pumped up and inspired


679
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,538
for karaoke night,
I like to turn


680
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:05,277
to my Eddy karaoke album,
so let's do that now.


681
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,545
Show my karaoke photos of Eddy.


682
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:15,719
Oh, that is the master at work.


683
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:22,226
Hitting -- I love this hat.


684
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,263
[Laughter] This is totally dope.


685
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,464
Great stuff.


686
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,199
Well, I could really look
at these just all day,


687
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,501
but you know, actually,


688
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,003
my assistant has given
me a reminder based


689
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,105
on traffic conditions that it's
time to leave, so I am going


690
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,375
to wrap up this demo of
intelligence on iOS 9.


691
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:45,784
[Cheers and applause]


692
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,052
So you've seen how
we've been able


693
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:52,090
to bring intelligence throughout
the experience in iOS 9,


694
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:58,063
but we do it in a way that does
not compromise your privacy.


695
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:01,999
We don't mine your email,
your photos, or your contacts


696
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,135
in the cloud to learn
things about you.


697
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,872
We honestly just
don't want to know.


698
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,676
All of this is done on
device, and it stays


699
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,412
on device, under your control.


700
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:22,053
[Cheers and applause]


701
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,556
And if we do have to perform
a lookup on your behalf,


702
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,459
for example, for current traffic
conditions, it's anonymous,


703
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,261
it's not associated with your
Apple ID, it's not linked


704
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,696
with other Apple services,


705
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,265
and it's not shared
with third parties.


706
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,133
Why would do you that?


707
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,469
It is in your control.


708
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,438
That is intelligence in iOS 9.


709
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:46,478
[Applause]


710
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,680
Next, let's turn to Apple Pay.


711
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,649
And to take you through
it, I'd like to bring


712
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,885
to the stage our Vice President


713
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,254
of our Apple Pay
business, Jennifer Bailey.


714
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,455
Jennifer.


715
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:01,493
[Cheers and applause]


716
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,260
>> JENNIFER BAILEY:
Thanks, Craig.


717
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,163
It's great to be here.


718
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,401
We have been hard at work on our
goal of replacing the wallet,


719
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,604
and we've got some exciting
updates for you today.


720
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,508
I hope you've all tried Apple
Pay with our super easy, secure,


721
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,610
and private way to pay.


722
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,013
Last year we started with credit
and debit cards, and we now have


723
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,383
over 2,500 banks
supporting Apple Pay.


724
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,953
And this fall, Discover will
bring Apple Pay to the more


725
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,489
than 50 million card members.


726
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:36,928
[Applause]


727
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,532
Popular merchants are also
expanding their acceptance


728
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,301
for Apple Pay, including
great retailers


729
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,370
who will be supporting
Apple Pay this year,


730
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,008
including Trader Joe's,
Baskin-Robbins, and JCPenny.


731
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:53,278
These incredible brands join
a great list of the biggest


732
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:55,280
and best merchants
supporting Apple Pay


733
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,748
since our launch in October.


734
00:36:56,748 --> 00:37:00,318
And for you are basketball
fans, if you are lucky enough


735
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,987
to have finals tickets,
you will be able to pay


736
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,525
for all your team logo wear at
both arenas using Apple Pay.


737
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:12,564
[Applause]


738
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,133
Small businesses are
also important for us,


739
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,535
so we are working with
innovative companies like Square


740
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,139
to enable millions of small
businesses to accept Apple Pay.


741
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:26,311
This fall, Square will
launch a gorgeous new reader.


742
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:29,514
Preorders are starting
today on square.com,


743
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,682
and these will be available


744
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:34,052
in our Apple Retail
Stores starting this fall.


745
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:38,123
With fantastic support of
merchants, both large and small,


746
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:42,093
we will surpass 1 million
locations accepting Apple Pay


747
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,561
next month.


748
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:49,300
[Applause]


749
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,270
And thanks to our
amazing developers,


750
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,772
we have great momentum
within apps as well.


751
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,876
Apple Pay is so easy
to use in-app,


752
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:01,012
our developers are telling
us they are seeing more


753
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,749
than two times increase
in checkout rates.


754
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,018
And we are adding new
apps with Apple Pay


755
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,920
to the App Store every day.


756
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,422
Here are some of the latest,
representing a great range


757
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:15,093
of categories, from
Delta in travel to Etsy,


758
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,729
the leading crafts marketplace.


759
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:22,033
These apps join an incredible
group that are redefining new


760
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,737
and simpler ways to pay.


761
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:29,040
We're also excited to be
working with Pinterest.


762
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,709
Later this month, Pinterest
will launch Buyable Pins,


763
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,547
where you will be able to buy
items from thousands of stores,


764
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,383
including Neiman
Marcus and Macy's,


765
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:42,053
right from within the
Pinterest app using Apple Pay,


766
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,622
and only on iOS.


767
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:52,397
[Applause]


768
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,599
With the great momentum
of Apple Pay in the U.S.,


769
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,434
we are now excited to announce


770
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,637
that we are bringing
Apple Pay to the UK.


771
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:04,976
[Cheers and applause]


772
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,146
And it's coming next month!


773
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,681
[Applause]


774
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,984
We will launch with eight
of the most popular banks,


775
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,787
with more coming this fall.


776
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,223
With this great lineup of
banks, we will support more


777
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:23,127
than 70 percent of the credit
and debit cards in the UK.


778
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,897
Great merchants are also
lining up to support Apple Pay,


779
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:30,068
like Boots, Costa Coffee,
and iconic British brands,


780
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,103
like Marks and Spencer
and Waitrose.


781
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:36,174
We will have over 250,000
locations supporting Apple Pay


782
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,275
in the UK.


783
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,010
That's more than we
started with in the U.S.


784
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,446
at our initial launch.


785
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,881
We are also thrilled that
our customers will be able


786
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,850
to commute and pay
for their fares


787
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,687
on the London transportation
system with Apple Pay.


788
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:56,828
[Applause]


789
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,296
So that's Apple Pay
coming to the UK.


790
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:01,099
Now let's talk about
some of the new features


791
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,701
that we are adding in iOS 9.


792
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,970
First, you will be
able to add your store,


793
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,406
credit, and debit cards.


794
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,709
Store cards offer unique
membership benefits,


795
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,113
and leading retailers
like Kohl's, JCPenney,


796
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:19,617
and BJs will be the first to
offer their cards on Apple Pay.


797
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,654
We will also add loyalty
and rewards cards,


798
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,822
also with a great
lineup of merchants.


799
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,892
Kohl's will bring
Yes2You programs,


800
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,362
Walgreens their Balance Rewards
card, and for your coffee


801
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:35,066
and doughnut lovers, Dunkin'
Donuts will bring Apple Pay


802
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,736
to their DDPerks
beginning this fall.


803
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:44,242
[Applause]


804
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:47,912
and Apple Pay automatically
presents the right card,


805
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,114
so you will never miss a reward.


806
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,885
With the expansion of Apple
Pay and the new types of cards,


807
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:58,756
we decided it's time to
rename Passbook to Wallet.


808
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:04,929
[Applause]


809
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,199
One place for all your credit
and debit cards, loyalty cards,


810
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,702
boarding passes, and more.


811
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,571
We told you last year
that our ultimate goal was


812
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,239
to replace the wallet,
and we are well


813
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,209
on the way to doing just that.


814
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:22,146
We couldn't be happier with
the progress towards our vision


815
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,048
and with the momentum
of Apple Pay.


816
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,783
Thank you.


817
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:34,859
[Applause]


818
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:36,861
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's Apple Pay.


819
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,030
Let's turn now to
our enhancements


820
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,935
to the apps you use most, and we
are going to start with Notes.


821
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,206
Notes is used regularly by about
half of our users on iPhone,


822
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,943
and for iOS 9, we have some
really great enhancements.


823
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,178
It starts with how you
work with simple text.


824
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,849
So now Notes provides
a really handy toolbar


825
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,318
with formatting options,
so it's easy, for instance,


826
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,222
to create titles, heading
styles, numbered lists.


827
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:07,725
But of course, we all like to
create checklists in our notes,


828
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,827
and so Notes makes
that really easy.


829
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,463
And of course, you can
just check off your items


830
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,198
with just a tap.


831
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,934
Now, because a picture is
worth a thousand words,


832
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,171
we make it easy to get at your
camera and your camera roll


833
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,241
and put photos directly
in your notes.


834
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:27,578
We are also providing a great
new way to capture your ideas


835
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,381
by just drawing with
your finger.


836
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,250
We provide some great
drawing tools.


837
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,218
You can make sketches
with these tools


838
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,854
and drop them right
inside your note.


839
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:41,058
[Applause]


840
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,794
Now, I don't know
if you are like me,


841
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,328
but a lot of times the
things I want to put


842
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,164
on my notes are things I
am looking at that I find


843
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,600
in other apps -- for
instance, a web page in Safari.


844
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,270
So now from the Share
sheet, you can just


845
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,507
with a tap add a link
right back into your notes.


846
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,310
And we make it really
easy to find your notes.


847
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,179
So we organize them
by time, of course,


848
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,780
and now we have these
great thumbnails


849
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,749
to let you see your
embedded images at a glance,


850
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,653
but we also provide this
cool new Attachments view


851
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:12,657
that shows you all of your
photos, your maps links,


852
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,660
your website links, and when
you tap, you can get right back


853
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,361
to the note where
they came from.


854
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,466
Now, Notes is great
on iPhone, on iPad,


855
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,034
and of course, on
the Mac as well.


856
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:26,737
And all of your content is
kept up to date across all


857
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,373
of your devices via iCloud.


858
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,909
That's a quick update to Notes.


859
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:37,582
[Applause]


860
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,550
Next, let's turn to Maps.


861
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,587
We've continued to
invest heavily in Maps,


862
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,755
and the improvements
are really awesome.


863
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:49,460
We are seeing five billion
user requests per week.


864
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,964
Usage on iOS is 3.5 times higher


865
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:56,133
than for the next
leading mapping app.


866
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,802
Now, Maps, of course,


867
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,539
historically have been
focused on drivers.


868
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:04,876
They emphasize things
like freeways and roads.


869
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:09,547
But we know for a lot of our iOS
users, they are mostly focused


870
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:13,851
on public transit, and so now
we've created a great map just


871
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,287
for them.


872
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,956
[Applause] Yes, it's Transit.


873
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,293
[Applause]


874
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,729
With Transit, we provide
a map that emphasizes all


875
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:28,032
of the different transit
lines, buses, and trains,


876
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,469
subway stations and so forth,
and when you tap on a station,


877
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,704
you can see all the
lines that run through it


878
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,273
with their departure times.


879
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:40,177
And we do multimodal routing,
whether you are taking a train,


880
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,047
a subway, a bus, or a ferry.


881
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,751
And we provide step-by-step
directions, including time


882
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,052
for walking directions.


883
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:52,290
But we've taken special care
to get the details right,


884
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,926
the ones that matter,
with Transit.


885
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:58,396
For instance, if you take a
subway station like this one


886
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:03,501
in Columbus Circle in New York,
it's not just a point on a map.


887
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,835
If you look closer,


888
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:08,039
it's actually an enormous
underground structure spanning


889
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:13,244
many city blocks, and so
we carefully surveyed all


890
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,746
of the entrances and exits


891
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,649
so that we could give you
walking directions based


892
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,786
on the time to travel from
where you actually are.


893
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:24,188
Now, this not only saves
you a ton of walking,


894
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,823
but it also probably
is the difference


895
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,926
between catching your train
on time and being stuck.


896
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,028
[Applause] It's really great.


897
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:37,335
[Applause]


898
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:40,605
We've taught Siri all about
Transit, so it's effortless


899
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,541
to ask Siri for directions.


900
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:46,811
And we are going to be
rolling Maps out, Transit,


901
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:51,816
starting with these cities
across the world, and --


902
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:55,052
[Applause] -- with these
and 300 more in China.


903
00:45:55,052 --> 00:46:02,259
[Applause]


904
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,995
Now, when it comes
to searching in Maps,


905
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,230
we are now letting
you find locations


906
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,432
by type nearby with just a tap.


907
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,769
And when you find the
location you are interested in,


908
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,771
the card will tell you
right away right there


909
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,140
in the bottom whether
they support Apple Pay.


910
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,075
Support those Apple
Pay merchants.


911
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,912
[Applause]


912
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,349
Maps is great on
iPhone and iPad,


913
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,853
and of course, the Mac as well.


914
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:31,088
And that is Maps.


915
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:37,962
[Applause]


916
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:42,566
The apps that we've chosen
to build in to iOS are there


917
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,103
because they represent
fundamental experiences


918
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,339
to living on a mobile device.


919
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:51,842
And there's been one that we've
been wanting to do for years,


920
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,346
something that so many of
us find ourselves wanting


921
00:46:55,346 --> 00:47:00,518
to do every day on our device,
and so today I'm pleased


922
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:04,321
to announce that we are
introducing a new application,


923
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,058
and it's called News.


924
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:10,428
News is beautiful content


925
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:15,199
from the world's greatest
sources personalized for you.


926
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,069
Now, here's an article in News.


927
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,104
It's absolutely stunning.


928
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,941
Now, publishers can easily
create beautiful content using


929
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:30,381
gorgeous imagery, custom
layout, and rich typography.


930
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:33,884
But News is also interactive,
and so to give you a look


931
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,654
at News in action,
I'd like to invite


932
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:39,724
to the stage our Vice
President of Application,


933
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,393
Product Management,
Susan Prescott.


934
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:43,160
Susan.


935
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,698
[Cheers and applause]


936
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:52,303
>> SUSAN PRESCOTT:
Thanks, Craig.


937
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,404
Thank you.


938
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:54,772
I am really excited
to be the first person


939
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:56,006
to show you our new News app.


940
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,409
It's right here on
the Home screen.


941
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,545
The first thing News wants to do
is get a sense of what I like,


942
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,880
so it's going to
give me a short list


943
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,883
of really great choices
to choose from.


944
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,820
And you'll see as I tap,
additional recommendations come


945
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,623
in on the bottom to give
you even more choices.


946
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,060
So I read Atlantic, Wired,
New York Times, and ESPN.


947
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,929
I am still with you, Warriors!


948
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,332
And Daring Fireball.


949
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:25,436
Topics, too, like science,
baking, and travel.


950
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:28,105
I could keep going, but I
think that's a great start,


951
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,474
so I will tap Done.


952
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,145
News creates a personalized
feed called For You.


953
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,781
It's based on the
choices I just made,


954
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:39,550
and it's all my News
in one place.


955
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,119
You can see it looks great.


956
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:48,359
It's easy to scan, and it
updates every time I check News.


957
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,528
The articles can
come from anywhere,


958
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:54,932
but the best ones are built
in our new Apple News format,


959
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,601
like this Wired article
featuring Rashida Jones,


960
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,771
awesome in Parks &
Rec and The Office.


961
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:05,009
Look at the rich
typography, beautiful images,


962
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:09,146
and my favorite part are
the really fun animations.


963
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,581
It's fast and fluid.


964
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:15,085
We think this offers the best
mobile reading experience ever.


965
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:19,023
To get to the next
article, I just swipe.


966
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:20,991
It's not just great
for magazines;


967
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,226
it's great for newspapers too.


968
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,495
This is a New York Times
article, and it looks


969
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,330
like a New York Times article.


970
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,101
Swipe down, there's a photo
gallery right in line, fast,


971
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,003
fluid to swipe through.


972
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,539
Go to the next article,
this one's from Quartz,


973
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,376
but I am seeing it because I
said I am interested in science.


974
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,579
It's a pretty cool
article about a font based


975
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,614
on Albert Einstein's
handwriting.


976
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:46,083
The animation makes it
come to life, and frankly,


977
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,785
who knew he had such
neat handwriting?


978
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,854
It's kind of interesting.


979
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:53,824
Swipe again, and I get an
article from Bon Appetit.


980
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,227
Great summer recipes,


981
00:49:56,227 --> 00:50:00,698
and a crazy little jiggly
thing, which is kind of fun.


982
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:03,434
[Laughter] So I am a little
busy right now, so I am going


983
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,036
to go ahead and bookmark
this to read later.


984
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:11,308
Now, ESPN, I love you, Steph.


985
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,545
[Applause]


986
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,314
Now, I read ESPN
for the articles,


987
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,751
but there's also
some beautiful --


988
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:24,321
[Laughter] -- photos and videos.


989
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:32,129
[Cheers and applause]


990
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,231
Some photos and videos built in.


991
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,232
Not so much last night.


992
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,202
Let's see if Steph
can make this one.


993
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,370
Swish. All right.


994
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,139
He is going to be
there for us next game.


995
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:47,945
In addition, data and stats are
part of what's fun about sports,


996
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:50,247
so of course, rich info
graphics can be part of it.


997
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,216
I am going to swipe
back to For You.


998
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,986
Now, News is smart, so the
more I read, the better it gets


999
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,555
at showing me stories
I am interested in.


1000
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,725
But what if I want to
discover something new?


1001
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,496
I can tap here in the bottom
on Explore, and Explore,


1002
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:06,830
based on what I've read,


1003
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,234
will show me new publisher
channels I might be interested


1004
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,603
in and suggested topics.


1005
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,505
Well, I love technology.


1006
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,573
I am going to go
ahead and follow that.


1007
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,311
But News keeps track of
more than a million topics.


1008
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,447
So I can be much more
specific about my interests.


1009
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,016
To do that, I can tap
on Search and type.


1010
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,218
I am going to type Swift.


1011
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:32,823
And I get a number of hits,
everything from Taylor Swift,


1012
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:33,991
to what I was looking for,


1013
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:36,160
Apple's new programming
language.


1014
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,964
So it's a beautiful feed,
and what's really cool


1015
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:43,100
about this is there are powerful
machine learning algorithms


1016
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,602
that analyze the contents
of the articles to figure


1017
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,839
out which stories
belong in which article.


1018
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,741
This looks like just
what I was hoping for.


1019
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:54,511
I am going to go ahead and
add Swift to my Favorites.


1020
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,146
So let's take a look
at Favorites.


1021
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,248
I will tap down here.


1022
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:01,185
Favorites is where I can see
everything I am following,


1023
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:04,021
including Swift,
which I just added.


1024
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,956
It's a great place to
go if I want to dig


1025
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,758
into a particular
topic or if I want


1026
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,793
to read a newspaper
or a magazine.


1027
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,763
Let's say today I
want to read Wired.


1028
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:14,031
You can tell I am in
the Wired channel.


1029
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,532
You see the Wired
logo at the top


1030
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:19,503
and the Wired channel
starting with Top Stories.


1031
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,773
I can swipe through and see a
collection of the all the print


1032
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:25,542
and web stories built
in Apple News format,


1033
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:26,543
and it looks terrific.


1034
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,681
I am going to look
at one more story.


1035
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:35,486
This is about the first
civilian artist in space.


1036
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,788
Cool concept and really cool.


1037
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:40,290
I want to show you this.


1038
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,993
We've taken photo
galleries to the next level


1039
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,362
with something we
call Photo Mosaics.


1040
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,699
Look how beautiful
it looks on the page.


1041
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:52,102
Stunning. And, as you'd expect,


1042
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:56,407
I just tap to zoom
in on the photos.


1043
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,609
It looks great.


1044
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:01,045
We think there's never been a
more beautiful magazine reading


1045
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,414
experience, a mobile reading
experience in general,


1046
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,716
and this is just
one of many channels


1047
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,485
with beautiful stories
built in Apple News format.


1048
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,387
That is a really
quick look at News.


1049
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,722
We can't wait to get
it in your hands.


1050
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,490
Thank you very much.


1051
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:22,566
[Cheers and applause]


1052
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,502
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's News.


1053
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,771
Stunning content.


1054
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,606
Personalized for you.


1055
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:34,278
Fantastic on iPad and
on iPhone as well.


1056
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,680
And of course, unlike just


1057
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,249
about any other news
aggregation service we are aware


1058
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:42,186
of on the planet, News is
designed from the ground


1059
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:45,255
up with your privacy in mind.


1060
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,825
We worked with leading
publishers,


1061
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,159
like The New York Times,


1062
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,297
who will be delivering 33
articles daily to News users,


1063
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:56,900
and ESPN, who will be
bringing the depth and range


1064
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,136
of their phenomenal
sports reporting.


1065
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:02,639
And Conde Nast, who are
bringing content from 17


1066
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,044
of their magazines, like
Vanity Fair, Vogue, GQ,


1067
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:09,213
Wired, and Bon Appetite.


1068
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:12,382
And they will be joined
by many, many others read


1069
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,985
by millions of users daily.


1070
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,589
News isn't just for
the media titans.


1071
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,658
Great content comes from
all kinds of sources,


1072
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:25,829
and we want them all in News, so
whether it's a local newspaper,


1073
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,032
a blog, or a special-interest
publication,


1074
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,567
they will all be here.


1075
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:35,472
We will be rolling out News
starting in the United States,


1076
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,108
the UK, and Australia.


1077
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,577
We think you are
really going to like it.


1078
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:49,086
[Applause]


1079
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,188
Next, let's turn to iPad.


1080
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:56,326
Now, iPad is a transformational
device.


1081
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:02,366
For our users in education,
business, and at home,


1082
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:07,171
for many of them, their iPad
is their primary computer.


1083
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:11,308
And iPads are just tremendously
powerful, so in iOS 9,


1084
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,512
we are elevating the iPad
experience to a whole new level.


1085
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,614
Now, it starts with
something really simple,


1086
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,384
which is how you work with text.


1087
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,886
That brings us to the
QuickType keyboard.


1088
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:26,256
Now, in iOS 8, we
introduced the Suggestion bar


1089
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,358
that makes it quicker
than ever to type


1090
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,128
and enter what you
are trying to get in.


1091
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:36,133
But now, in iOS 9, we've
added shortcuts to that bar,


1092
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:40,170
so with just a tap, you can cut,
copy, paste, format your text,


1093
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,605
access your attachments.


1094
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,373
It's really handy.


1095
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,843
But you know, what makes
a Multi-Touch keyboard


1096
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,479
so special is that it
can be anything you want.


1097
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,014
It can transform.


1098
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:55,986
So now when you want to move
the cursor or make a selection,


1099
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:59,456
you can now just put two
fingers down on the keyboard,


1100
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,658
and it becomes a
trackpad instantly.


1101
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:07,364
[Applause]


1102
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,767
You can move the cursor,
you can make selections.


1103
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,270
Of course, you can use
the shortcut bar to cut,


1104
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,607
drag to a new place, and
paste, editing more quickly


1105
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:19,209
than ever before and without
your fingers ever leaving the


1106
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:19,843
home row.


1107
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,678
It's really great.


1108
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:26,450
[Applause]


1109
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,885
And if you do occasionally want
to hook a physical keyboard


1110
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,922
to your iPad as well, we
made that better than ever.


1111
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:34,157
We provide a way to
discover all of the shortcuts


1112
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,093
that can accelerate
your operations


1113
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:38,262
in the applications
using the keyboard,


1114
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,931
and we've provided
shortcuts for app switching.


1115
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,499
This might look familiar
to some of you.


1116
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:46,703
As well as to searching
in Spotlight.


1117
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,507
So that's QuickType, but now
I want to turn to the big one,


1118
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,709
and that's Multitasking.


1119
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:58,649
[Applause]


1120
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:01,885
So iPad has always supported
forms of multitasking,


1121
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,087
like this great graphical
task switcher,


1122
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,189
and these nice four-finger
gestures


1123
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,892
that let you move
between applications.


1124
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:12,696
But for iOS 9, we are taking
it to a whole new place,


1125
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:15,732
and I'd like to show
that to you now.


1126
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:21,004
[Applause]


1127
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,306
So let's start here on my iPad.


1128
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:24,975
And what I am going to
do first is double-tap


1129
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:29,746
on the Home button, and you
will see our new task switcher.


1130
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,982
It's really gorgeous.


1131
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:36,687
Big, full-screen
previews of all the apps.


1132
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,522
Just move right into
Safari like this.


1133
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:40,657
But of course, often when
I am in an app like Safari,


1134
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,393
I then just want to
quickly check my messages.


1135
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:47,197
So now with just a single
finger swipe from the side,


1136
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,233
I can slide it right in with
what we call Slide Over.


1137
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,135
Of course, it's fully
interactive.


1138
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,138
I can take a quick look,
maybe type a response,


1139
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,207
put it right back,
I am back in Safari.


1140
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,809
Do that again.


1141
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:04,214
From the top, I can pull down
and bring in other applications.


1142
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,615
So let's bring in Calendar.


1143
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,552
Of course, fully interactive
so I can tap into another day.


1144
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:09,653
Let's bring in another app.


1145
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:13,290
I am going to bring
in the new Notes app.


1146
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,658
Just like that.


1147
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,460
Now, sometimes, of course, I
want to stay working in Notes


1148
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,496
and Safari both at the same
time, so I can just tap here


1149
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,332
on the divider, and
now I am in split view.


1150
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,168
They are both completely active.


1151
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:29,005
In fact, for the first time
ever, multiapp, Multi-Touch,


1152
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,808
I can move them both
at the same time.


1153
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:38,348
[Applause]


1154
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,051
Now, Notes is actually
pinned to the side now,


1155
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,786
so I want to show you what
happens when I switch apps.


1156
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:45,455
I am just going to move
over here to Photos.


1157
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,824
You notice now I have Photos
with Notes on the side.


1158
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,559
This is really great if I am
taking notes while working


1159
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,595
across a bunch of experiences.


1160
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:53,964
And of course those four-finger
gestures continue to work great,


1161
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:56,800
so I can swipe my way
right back into Safari.


1162
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,703
I can follow links, of
course, from my notes.


1163
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:03,874
Let me tap on this link, and you
see Safari loads it right here


1164
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:04,808
on the side.


1165
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,076
I can adjust the split.


1166
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,545
Let me move that over
to a nice 50/50 view


1167
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,147
with Notes and Safari.


1168
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:11,815
I can tap on links
to other apps,


1169
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:16,052
so let's follow a
link into Maps.


1170
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,455
Maps -- I really want
location accuracy.


1171
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,791
Thank you, very helpful.


1172
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,994
Slides right in and
shows me the location.


1173
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,430
I can follow another
link, Maps adjusts,


1174
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,465
I am able to stay
focused right here


1175
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,567
in these two apps side by side.


1176
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,403
Let's say I now want to
work Notes full screen.


1177
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,472
I can pull right
across like that


1178
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:37,107
and I am in full-screen Notes.


1179
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:38,542
This gives me a great
opportunity


1180
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,244
to show you what's new with
the QuickType keyboard.


1181
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,447
I have a to-do list
I am building here.


1182
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:49,886
I am going to add an item
here to buy a new ice chest.


1183
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,087
There we go.


1184
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,590
On second thought, I
should probably borrow one.


1185
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,258
I am going to take two fingers


1186
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,794
down on the keyboard,
swipe over here.


1187
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,196
I can reposition the
cursor like this.


1188
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,298
Tap and make a selection.


1189
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:03,733
Extend the selection.


1190
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:04,835
And type "borrow."


1191
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:06,102
It's really easy.


1192
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,437
I can make bigger moves too.


1193
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,540
I can go to the top here, maybe
select the whole sentence,


1194
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:16,112
drag down, maybe do a checklist
like this, and check them off.


1195
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,247
Just like that.


1196
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:18,915
Super cool.


1197
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:23,987
[Applause]


1198
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,923
Next I want to show you
multitasking in the context


1199
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:30,560
of something I think we all
do quite a bit on our iPads,


1200
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,831
which is not that --
which is watching ESPN.


1201
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,633
So let's bring up a video.


1202
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:40,036
I am going to play right here.


1203
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:43,473
Now, often when I am watching
a video, I may decide I want


1204
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,041
to look something up
or check something


1205
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,411
or maybe even get a
notification, and I want you


1206
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,880
to watch what happens
when I tap.


1207
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,048
Watch the video.


1208
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,950
Now I have Picture in Picture.


1209
01:00:53,950 --> 01:01:00,190
[Applause]


1210
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:04,594
So I can still listen, I
can watch my video, I can,


1211
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:08,365
of course, resize the
PIP if I want, like this.


1212
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:11,001
I can move it around the
screen so it's out of the way


1213
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,802
of what I am working on.


1214
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,138
I can even move it off the side.


1215
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,474
Sometimes I just want to listen
for a while while I work.


1216
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:20,243
Of course, it stays
with me wherever I go.


1217
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,579
I can pull it back,
and when I am done,


1218
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:23,880
just tap to put it away.


1219
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,985
And that is Multitasking
in iOS 9.


1220
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:34,824
[Applause]


1221
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,061
So iOS 9 delivers this great
app switcher, and of course,


1222
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,531
that's available
on iPhone as well.


1223
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,634
On iPad, we have Slide
Over so you can bring apps


1224
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,069
in from the side.


1225
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,305
You can tap and enter split view


1226
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:52,275
for simultaneous
live two apps up.


1227
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,945
And of course, Picture
in Picture.


1228
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:58,415
Now, we provide developer APIs
to let your apps work this way,


1229
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:02,352
and the good news is that you've
already done most of that work


1230
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:05,322
because if you've adopted
Auto Layout and size classes


1231
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:09,259
to work great on the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus, well, that carries


1232
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:13,597
over just like this onto iPad.


1233
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:16,466
Twitter came in and was able
to do it just in minutes.


1234
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,069
It was really incredible.


1235
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:24,207
Now, Slide Over is available
for the iPad Air, Air 2, mini 2,


1236
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,977
and mini 3, as is
Picture in Picture,


1237
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:29,546
and our most powerful
split view is available


1238
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:33,483
on our most powerful
iPad, the iPad Air 2.


1239
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,051
That's Multitasking.


1240
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:43,193
[Applause]


1241
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:46,429
So we've seen some
great end-user features,


1242
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,266
but of course, we've also
focused on the foundations.


1243
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:56,206
In performance, as you saw
earlier in El Capitan with OS X,


1244
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:59,209
we've taken the core frameworks
that we use for drawing


1245
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,711
on the system, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,


1246
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:02,912
and we put them on top of Metal.


1247
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,914
We are seeing great
acceleration,


1248
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:08,685
1.6 times improvements in
animations and scrolling,


1249
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:11,621
and a 50 percent reduction
in CPU usage for drawing.


1250
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,390
It's really great.


1251
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,425
With battery life, we focused


1252
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:19,162
on real-world use cases
and optimized them.


1253
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:23,400
And we are seeing an addition
of one hour of typical use


1254
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,102
on a full charge on iPhone.


1255
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:30,507
[Applause]


1256
01:03:30,507 --> 01:03:32,776
Now, we know that for a lot
of you if you are running low


1257
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:35,378
on power, you start searching
all over for switches


1258
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,213
and turning off features
in the hope


1259
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,350
of extending your battery
life a little bit further.


1260
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,319
Well, now in iOS 9, we
give you a single switch


1261
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,356
to enter what we call Low
Power mode, and it pulls levers


1262
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,892
that you didn't even
know existed and is able


1263
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:53,463
to extend battery life for
an additional three hours


1264
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,965
of typical use on top
of that additional hour.


1265
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,133
It's really great.


1266
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:02,939
[Applause]


1267
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,975
Now, with security, we want
to protect our users' data


1268
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,610
on device and in the cloud,


1269
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,246
and so we are bringing
two-factor authentication


1270
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:15,218
and making it easy for everyone
to protect their data in iCloud.


1271
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:20,423
And with Software Update, we
want everyone to get to iOS 9,


1272
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,527
and so we've done major
enhancements to the architecture


1273
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,796
for our over-the-air
updates, and we have been able


1274
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:31,134
to reduce the amount of free
space you need to get to iOS 9


1275
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:35,138
from the 4.6 gigs that
it took to get to iOS 8


1276
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,807
down to just 1.3, so we
think everybody is going


1277
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,175
to be getting to iOS 9.


1278
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:45,348
[Applause]


1279
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:48,351
So iOS 9, intelligence
throughout the system,


1280
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:53,123
Apple Pay, enhancements to
really popular apps like Notes


1281
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:58,528
and Maps, an all-new News app,
and incredible features now


1282
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:01,931
for iPad with Multitasking
and QuickType, and of course,


1283
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,300
enhancements to the foundations.


1284
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,272
Now, iOS 9 is a great release
for our users, but once again,


1285
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:13,510
it's a fantastic release
for all of you developers,


1286
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,011
bringing a ton of new features.


1287
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,546
You saw search extensibility.


1288
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:19,482
We are adding UI
testing to Xcode.


1289
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,583
[Cheers and applause] Yes!


1290
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,687
We have a new technology
called App Thinning,


1291
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,857
which optimizes your
downloads to exactly the subset


1292
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,860
of resources needed for that
user's device, so you are able


1293
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,229
to get -- take less
space on device.


1294
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:34,731
It's really great.


1295
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:37,867
Now, when it comes to gaming,
we've enhanced SpriteKit,


1296
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:41,538
SceneKit, and Metal and
introduced three new frameworks,


1297
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:44,040
GameplayKit to bring
artificial intelligence


1298
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,378
with path avoid obstacle
avoidance and path finding;


1299
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:50,613
Model I/O to provide
beautiful lighting


1300
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,550
on your 3D models;
and ReplayKit.


1301
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,685
It lets you enhance
your applications


1302
01:05:55,685 --> 01:06:00,190
to let users record their game
play as video and share it.


1303
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,258
It's really great.


1304
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:08,798
[Applause]


1305
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,468
Now, HealthKit has been on
fire, so we've continued --


1306
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,671
well, we added water,
actually, to HealthKit.


1307
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,406
We are not trying
to put out the fire.


1308
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:20,376
We are adding lots of additional
health metrics to be tracked,


1309
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,746
for instance, hydration,
UV exposure,


1310
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,481
and reproductive health.


1311
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,252
Now, HomeKit has been taking off


1312
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,588
with manufacturers
introducing HomeKit peripherals


1313
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:36,759
to the market now in areas like
thermometers, locks, and lights.


1314
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,229
And now in iOS 9, we
are adding support


1315
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:42,232
for window shades,
sensors of all kinds.


1316
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:46,002
For instance, carbon monoxide
sensors, motion sensors.


1317
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,873
And we're adding support for
security systems as well.


1318
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:52,442
Perhaps most importantly,
we are allowing you


1319
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:57,247
to access your home remotely
and securely via iCloud.


1320
01:06:57,247 --> 01:07:00,049
So no matter where you
are, you can control all


1321
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,318
of your HomeKit devices.


1322
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:09,559
[Applause]


1323
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,060
Next, CarPlay.


1324
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:16,332
So CarPlay supports audio
apps and now, in iOS 9,


1325
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,936
it also supports apps by the
automaker to control things


1326
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:24,040
in your own car without
leaving the CarPlay experience.


1327
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,542
And CarPlay is supporting
more kinds of screens,


1328
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,845
wider aspect ratios, high DPI.


1329
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:32,882
But most significantly
with CarPlay,


1330
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,251
we are pulling the cord.


1331
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,388
In future cars, you will
be able to get in your car


1332
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:42,158
without taking your phone out of
your bag or out of your pocket


1333
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:46,095
and start experiencing
CarPlay effortlessly.


1334
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,364
It's going to be really great.


1335
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:53,369
[Applause]


1336
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:57,373
Finally, let's talk about Swift.


1337
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:02,345
[Cheers and applause]


1338
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,813
You all know that the growth


1339
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:07,417
that Swift has been experiencing
is just unprecedented,


1340
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,519
and we've all seen
it with the flood


1341
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,789
of applications coming
in to the App Store.


1342
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:18,094
Well, now we are stepping on
the gas this year with Swift 2.


1343
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,430
Now, Swift was designed from
the beginning to be fast,


1344
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,832
and we've continued to roll


1345
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,769
out targeted optimizations all
year long, and now with Swift 2,


1346
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,939
we have an all-new optimization
technology that's especially


1347
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,408
great for complex applications
and object-oriented programming


1348
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:36,412
that we call Whole
Module Optimization,


1349
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,816
and the results are
really fantastic.


1350
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,452
In addition, we are bringing
the language features


1351
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,354
that you've asked for most,


1352
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:46,522
an elegant new error
handling model,


1353
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,323
the ability to see
your interfaces


1354
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:51,894
as synthesized headers
in Xcode, and the feature


1355
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:56,399
that Tim has been begging for
all year, protocol extensions.


1356
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,102
You are all going to love it.


1357
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:04,607
Now, we think Swift is the
next big programming language,


1358
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,076
the one that we will
all be doing application


1359
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:11,913
and systems programming
on for 20 years to come.


1360
01:09:11,913 --> 01:09:17,520
And we think Swift should be
everywhere and used by everyone,


1361
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,555
and so we're going to be
doing something really big.


1362
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:25,461
Today we are announcing that
Swift will be open source.


1363
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:34,537
[Cheers and applause]


1364
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,854
We will be rolling
out the compiler


1365
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:56,959
and the standard libraries
for iOS, OS X, and Linux.


1366
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:02,598
And it will all be out there
by the end of the year.


1367
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:04,534
So that's Swift,
and that is iOS 9.


1368
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,770
We are doing a developer
beta -- you guessed it --


1369
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,940
today, and for the first
time for a major iOS release,


1370
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,811
a public beta, so sign
up now at beta.apple.com,


1371
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,146
and you can get the beta
when it comes out in July.


1372
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,082
And of course, we
will be rolling it


1373
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:21,184
out as a free upgrade
in the fall.


1374
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:25,988
And iOS 9 will support
all of the devices


1375
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,690
that were supported by iOS 8.


1376
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,092
We are not dropping
any this year


1377
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:32,028
because we want everyone
to get iOS 9.


1378
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:33,930
[Applause]


1379
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,831
That's iOS 9.


1380
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,632
I really appreciate your time.


1381
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:37,467
Have a fantastic conference.


1382
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:38,534
Thank you.


1383
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:45,942
[Cheers and applause]


1384
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,743
>> TIM COOK: Thanks,
Craig.


1385
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:52,882
iOS just keeps getting better
and better for our many hundreds


1386
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:56,185
of millions of users,
and iOS 9 takes it


1387
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:59,222
to an even greater level
with incredible new apps


1388
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:02,458
and intelligence
built right into iOS.


1389
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:06,896
And as an avid iPad user, I
am also incredibly excited


1390
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:11,834
about how far it extends the
iPad experience as we continue


1391
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,971
to lead in the post-PC era.


1392
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,841
With El Capitan, we've
created a new version of OS X


1393
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:22,011
that dramatically
improves the experience


1394
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:26,082
and the user experience and the
performance of the Macintosh.


1395
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:27,984
And of course, Swift.


1396
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:32,622
You've just heard Swift provides
a single language for you


1397
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:38,294
to create apps for
both OS X and iOS.


1398
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,431
There's really so many
possibilities for you


1399
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:46,335
to use these platforms
and these tools


1400
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:50,907
to create unbelievable apps
that will impact business


1401
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:56,746
and healthcare and education and
really everything in our lives.


1402
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:01,851
There's seemingly no
limit to what you can do.


1403
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:08,391
And of course, underpinning
this, the App Store is very key.


1404
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:13,262
It's hard to believe that the
App Store was launched only


1405
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,264
seven years ago.


1406
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:18,401
It's hard to remember
a day without it.


1407
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:20,603
Now, I'm happy to announce


1408
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:25,608
that the App Store recently
passed a major milestone.


1409
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:34,684
The App Store has passed
100 billion apps downloads.


1410
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:41,524
[Applause]


1411
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:45,061
The rate of growth
and the momentum is


1412
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,597
absolutely staggering.


1413
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:51,434
The industry has never seen
anything like this before.


1414
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:54,070
The App Store has
forever changed software


1415
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,872
and software distribution.


1416
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,610
And it's also been
an economic boon.


1417
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:04,680
We've now paid over $30
billion to developers.


1418
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:09,051
[Applause]


1419
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,553
The App Store continues


1420
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:17,126
to be the most profitable app
marketplace on the planet.


1421
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:24,600
Now, we could not be more proud
of the work that you are doing.


1422
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,072
More and more, developers
are transforming, empowering,


1423
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,608
and reimagining the
very important things


1424
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,745
that we do in our daily lives.


1425
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:41,317
We've made a video about
your incredible impact


1426
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:46,188
and just how far you've come
in such a short period of time,


1427
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,724
and I'd love to run
it for you now.


1428
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,002
>> Eight years ago, when
the iPhone was launched,


1429
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:01,337
it didn't have an App Store.


1430
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:06,509
And there was tremendous desire
on the part of developers


1431
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:08,544
and customers for Apple


1432
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,913
to let third-party
applications be created.


1433
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:15,151
We all had this dream
that apps were going


1434
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:19,522
to become really important,
but it took some time


1435
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:22,625
to realize how they would affect
everything that we care about,


1436
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:27,963
and as that cumulative effect
appeared, then we all start


1437
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,099
to realize, oh, my
goodness, this is bigger


1438
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,134
than any of us imagined.


1439
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:41,344
>> Apps plus handheld
devices,


1440
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:45,414
I think that's a watershed
moment in civilization.


1441
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,916
I put it up there
with the invention


1442
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,784
of the microscope
and the telescope.


1443
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:56,158
We live in a time where the most
powerful tools ever imagined


1444
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:00,129
to investigate and probe
our world are in the hand


1445
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:02,264
of essentially everyone.


1446
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,402
>> If you think the Industrial
Revolution was transformational,


1447
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:08,437
the App Store is way bigger.


1448
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,674
I don't think we've seen
anything reach a mass adoption


1449
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,109
at anything close to this pace.


1450
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:16,946
It took, for example,
electricity over a hundred years


1451
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:19,348
to get to its first
50 million users.


1452
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,852
It took television 13
years, and the App Store got


1453
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,354
to 50 million users
in only 17 months.


1454
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,868
>> The thing the App
Store did was give each


1455
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,469
and every developer a voice.


1456
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:44,140
It's a testament that two
guys in a room working


1457
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,543
on an idea can launch an app
and instantly have hundreds


1458
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,078
of millions of people
very quickly.


1459
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:54,784
The iPhone made photography
universally accessible.


1460
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,559
>> I cannot think
of a single industry


1461
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,528
that doesn't need an app.


1462
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:07,596
People want data at
their fingertips.


1463
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,865
They want personalized
experiences.


1464
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,202
They want power over
their money.


1465
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:16,772
And it's not just for banking;
it's for every industry.


1466
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,508
The App Store has fundamentally
shifted how we all need


1467
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:20,342
to deliver.


1468
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:23,412
It's leveling the playing field.


1469
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,118
>> We don't have to own
things.


1470
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:31,420
We don't have to
own our own cars.


1471
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,489
We don't have to
own our own music.


1472
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:37,226
We can call it up
when we need it.


1473
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:39,495
That's a big change, all
flowing from the idea


1474
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:42,264
of not just convenience
but people building


1475
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,700
up an infrastructure
around that.


1476
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,937
We are now talking
not about hundreds


1477
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:52,208
of people getting the benefits
of an idea, but millions.


1478
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,748
>> If you had told me when I
was a kid that you would be able


1479
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:04,553
to write an idea and then film
that idea and then distribute it


1480
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,722
to the world on a device
that you could also put


1481
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:10,092
in your pocket, I would
never have stopped laughing,


1482
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:12,862
and I would have
thought you were insane.


1483
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:15,130
The App Store gives
everyone access


1484
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:19,068
to incredibly powerful tools,


1485
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:22,171
and there's an incredible
generation of filmmakers


1486
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:24,106
and storytellers to come.


1487
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:37,253
>> Kids love technology,
and they love interacting


1488
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:40,890
with the iPad and with apps.


1489
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:44,860
That wonder and awe that gets
ignited is actually being


1490
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,030
utilized to help
that person learn.


1491
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,432
Certainly in education
there's so much potential


1492
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:53,769
to take the classroom
with you anywhere.


1493
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,776
>> We all know we are
in this magic moment.


1494
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:05,180
There are so many incredible
apps, and they do things


1495
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,517
for people that change
their lives.


1496
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,221
>> Music for me,
it's like everything.


1497
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:13,556
It's really special.


1498
01:18:13,556 --> 01:18:21,163
This amazing feeling that
music gives me, I want everyone


1499
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:25,267
to have that, even if
the person cannot hear.


1500
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:32,341
So the idea of the app is to
introduce music for deaf people.


1501
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:38,047
I am going to put these on
your wrist, so if you play,


1502
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:42,418
you can feel the vibrations.


1503
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,553
>> I can
feel it.


1504
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,556
>> Did you feel
that, Rob?


1505
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:57,366
My dream is to bring
music to everyone.


1506
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:04,807
>> It is an amazing
time to be a developer.


1507
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:07,509
We are still just at the
beginning of all this,


1508
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:11,614
this moment where the technology
of an iPhone and an iPad


1509
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:16,485
and the Watch enable so
many incredible things.


1510
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,657
There's so much that can
still change and evolve due


1511
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:24,059
to the power of applications.


1512
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:33,135
[Music]


1513
01:19:54,590 --> 01:20:03,666
[Applause]


1514
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:09,905
>> TIM COOK: On behalf
of everyone at Apple,


1515
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,840
we want to thank the
developer community


1516
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,542
for everything that you've done.


1517
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,110
Thank you.


1518
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:18,280
[Applause]


1519
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,451
You have changed so many
parts of all of our lives


1520
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:28,691
and transformed the
world in the process.


1521
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:32,995
Now, we want to talk about
now the next opportunity


1522
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,396
to transform the world.


1523
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:40,969
And that's the opportunity to
bring native apps to the Watch


1524
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:44,139
with a new version of watchOS.


1525
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:49,678
[Applause]


1526
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,950
For us, this is a giant moment.


1527
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:59,555
This is how we felt when
we launched the App Store.


1528
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:02,658
Opening a new platform
to developers


1529
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:07,429
to create new applications


1530
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,999
that can really change
people's lives.


1531
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,102
We really believe
deeply in this space.


1532
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:17,539
We believe in technology
designed for the wrist.


1533
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,808
And we believe by
opening up the platform


1534
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:25,114
that you will create
new and powerful uses


1535
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:28,350
that today we can
only begin to imagine.


1536
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:33,922
We began making the Apple Watch
available just six weeks ago,


1537
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:38,861
and it's pretty amazing that
today we're already talking


1538
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:43,031
about the next version
of the watchOS.


1539
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:48,003
This new version will have
great new capabilities,


1540
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:52,407
and it will bring native
apps right to your wrist.


1541
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:57,012
To tell you all about it, I'd
like to invite up my friend


1542
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:59,448
and colleague Kevin Lynch.


1543
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:00,215
Kevin.


1544
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:05,053
[Cheers and applause]


1545
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,555
>> KEVIN
LYNCH: Hi.


1546
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:11,760
So we're moving really fast on
watchOS, and I am super excited


1547
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,796
to talk with you about the
enhancements that are coming


1548
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:15,330
in watchOS, as well


1549
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,133
as the powerful new
abilities for app development.


1550
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,569
Let's start with
the enhancements.


1551
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:24,239
The enhancements include
great new Timepiece functions,


1552
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,176
improvements in communication
as well as in Health & Fitness,


1553
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:28,944
and support for the
new capabilities


1554
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,613
in Apple Pay, Maps, and Siri.


1555
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,816
Let's start with Timepiece.


1556
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:36,819
Now, already, Apple Watch
is a really great timepiece,


1557
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:39,521
the most customizable one in the
world, and a lot of that is due


1558
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:41,757
to the Watch faces and
how you can change them.


1559
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:44,927
We are adding some new
Watch faces in watchOS 2.


1560
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:47,629
That includes a beautiful
new Photos face to be able


1561
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,332
to select any photo you have and
create a Watch face out of it.


1562
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:53,902
You can create more than one and
switch between them as you like.


1563
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,637
Or you can select a photo album,


1564
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:56,972
and every time you
raise your wrist,


1565
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,274
you will see a different
photo from your album show up.


1566
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:02,444
It's a great way of seeing
your photos throughout the day.


1567
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,880
We went a little
further with this,


1568
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,315
and we shot some
photos ourselves.


1569
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,850
We did some time-lapse
photography


1570
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,419
in some beautiful
locations around the world.


1571
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:12,321
The way this works is
when you raise your wrist,


1572
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,590
you will see this
24-hour shoot we have done


1573
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:17,426
in different locations, and it
will be the current time there.


1574
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:19,328
If it's in noon, you
will see noon in London.


1575
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,697
If it's night, you'll
see Big Ben all lit up.


1576
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:23,065
We've done this not
only for London,


1577
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:24,700
but some other locations too.


1578
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,902
You can choose from
Hong Kong, Mack Lake --


1579
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:28,570
which a beautiful
place in the Sierras --


1580
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:32,107
as well as New York,
Shanghai, and London.


1581
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,943
It's a great way to see really
beautiful imagery, both your own


1582
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,678
and these time-lapse
images, on your wrist.


1583
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:40,215
You can customize your
Watch with these images


1584
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:42,317
but you can also choose to
show the information that you


1585
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,853
like on your Watch
face with something


1586
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,190
in traditional Watch terms
that's called Complications.


1587
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,094
With watchOS 2, we are really
excited to enable app developers


1588
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:54,329
to make your own Complications.


1589
01:23:54,329 --> 01:24:01,270
[Applause]


1590
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,906
So be able to do things
like show your flight time


1591
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:07,142
from United, see the state
of your home control system,


1592
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:09,411
look at the charge level
of your electric car,


1593
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:12,147
or see sports scores, for
example, from the MLB app.


1594
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,715
You can choose the
information that you most


1595
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,651
like to see right
on your Watch face.


1596
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,419
It's going to be
really, really cool.


1597
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,588
And this will work not
only on the modular face


1598
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,990
but across the others that
support Complications as well.


1599
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,393
You will be able to choose
from a variety of templates,


1600
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,161
and we'll make those
look beautiful in each


1601
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,063
of the different Watch faces.


1602
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,464
So it's going to be
a really fast way


1603
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:31,333
to look at this information.


1604
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,434
Now, we went further than this.


1605
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:34,102
We thought it's really
great to be able


1606
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,804
to see the current information,


1607
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,239
but what about future
information,


1608
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,942
like the weather later
today or your meeting


1609
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:41,910
after the current one?


1610
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,079
And what if you could go
forward in time and actually see


1611
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,848
that information update
on your Watch face?


1612
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:48,617
Well, we are supporting
that in watchOS 2


1613
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:51,420
with something we
call Time Travel.


1614
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,722
And you will be able to
rotate your Digital Crown,


1615
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:56,291
and you can go both forward
and backward through time,


1616
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:59,428
and the information will
update right on your screen.


1617
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:00,862
Let's take a look here.


1618
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,432
So I've got my meeting in
the middle there and weather


1619
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,901
and the charge level of
the car and time in London.


1620
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:08,670
When I rotate the Crown, you
can see it's changing the time


1621
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,906
and showing me things
that are coming up.


1622
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:13,075
Now, we know a really popular
one here might be the stocks


1623
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:15,243
Complication, but we
haven't cracked that one yet.


1624
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:19,147
We are working on it.


1625
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,116
You can keep rotating,
keep going forward,


1626
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,451
get all the way to tonight.


1627
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,353
You can see I have a date
night tonight, weather is going


1628
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:27,022
to be good, time in London will
be 2:00 a.m. You can see all the


1629
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:30,192
information you like to see in
the time you want to look at it.


1630
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:32,694
Really, really fun
way to interact


1631
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:35,063
with time on your Watch.


1632
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,432
That's Time Travel.


1633
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:42,871
[Applause]


1634
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,540
Now, we also thought, What
would be a great experience


1635
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,243
for the Watch when it's on
your nightstand and charging?


1636
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:50,345
Well, we've come up with a
new user interface for this


1637
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,981
in watchOS 2 called
Nightstand Mode.


1638
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,183
When you put your Watch on
its side and it's charging,


1639
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,652
you will get this beautiful
display now of the time,


1640
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,688
and of course, you can set
an alarm that will wake you


1641
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:03,191
up in the morning, and it
will go something like this.


1642
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,394
[Alarm tone]


1643
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:07,496
So a beautiful little
bedside alarm clock now


1644
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:10,065
with Apple Watch, and
the buttons on the side


1645
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:13,602
and the Crown act as your
Snooze and your Off button.


1646
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:17,105
A really fun way to have a
Nightstand view on your Watch.


1647
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,808
Those are some of the great
new Timepiece functions


1648
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:22,377
that are coming in watchOS 2.


1649
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:23,979
Let's look at communication.


1650
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:25,347
Now, already Apple
Watch is great


1651
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,015
at communicating
with your friends.


1652
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,052
You can just press the side
button and see your 12 friends


1653
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:31,420
that you have selected.


1654
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,555
Now, we realize that some of
you have more than 12 friends,


1655
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:36,558
so now in watchOS 2, you
can have different sets


1656
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:39,227
of friends you can select,
and you can add a friend right


1657
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:41,129
from your Watch by
pressing the plus sign


1658
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:43,732
and add a friend right there.


1659
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:45,500
Isn't that cool?


1660
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,570
[Applause]


1661
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,938
Now, when you are
communicating with someone,


1662
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:52,574
you can make a phone call or
send a message or send a drawing


1663
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:55,677
with Digital Touch, and now
in watchOS 2, you will be able


1664
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,546
to use multiple colors
in your drawings,


1665
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,481
so you can draw a
beautiful flower


1666
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,883
that has more than
just one color.


1667
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:05,387
Even my drawings are starting
to look better now with this.


1668
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,455
Also an email.


1669
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:08,123
You can already read
email on your Watch.


1670
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:11,526
With watchOS 2, you will
be able to reply to email.


1671
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:16,064
[Applause]


1672
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,933
And with the phone, you can
already take phone calls


1673
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:19,034
on your Watch.


1674
01:27:19,034 --> 01:27:20,502
We are now going to
support FaceTime Audio,


1675
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:22,537
so you will get really
high-fidelity calls right


1676
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,538
on your wrist.


1677
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:28,343
[Applause]


1678
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:29,911
And with Health & Fitness,


1679
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,848
already Apple Watch is a great
partner for Health & Fitness.


1680
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:36,251
With watchOS 2, we are enabling
your favorite fitness apps


1681
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,853
to run natively on the Watch


1682
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,889
so you can use them wherever
you are, and your workouts


1683
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:42,991
with these apps will
contribute directly


1684
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,360
to your all-day activity,
which will be really great,


1685
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,562
so if you go on a bike
ride, it will count.


1686
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,465
[Applause]


1687
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,934
We are also enabling
Siri to start workouts,


1688
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,137
so you can just raise your
wrist and say, hey, Siri,


1689
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:56,538
start a 30-minute
run in the park,


1690
01:27:56,538 --> 01:27:59,608
and it will start the Workout
app and get it going for you.


1691
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,211
You can also say things like
"go for a 300-calorie bike ride"


1692
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:06,515
or "go for a 5-mile run, "
and it will start the workout


1693
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:08,550
for you without having to
touch the watch at all.


1694
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,118
When you achieve something,


1695
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,721
there are some beautiful new
achievements you will see


1696
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,189
that look like this.


1697
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:15,957
They spin right in, they're
beautiful, you can play


1698
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,826
with them in 3D on the
Watch, they are engraved


1699
01:28:17,826 --> 01:28:20,962
on the back now with your
name, and you can share these


1700
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:24,065
with people over Messages,
Facebook, or Twitter.


1701
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:28,603
Really cool Health &
Fitness.


1702
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:31,940
[Applause]


1703
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,441
With Apple Pay, you saw some


1704
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,143
of the great new
support we are bringing


1705
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,645
for store cards and
rewards cards.


1706
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:38,213
We are supporting
that in the Watch,


1707
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:40,815
so you can select a store card
and use it right in your Watch


1708
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,951
in a merchant terminal
just by waving it


1709
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:44,085
at the store stand there.


1710
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:46,955
And with Wallet coming to Watch,


1711
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,690
all of your rewards cards
will be right there,


1712
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,659
and you can also use those
right from your Watch


1713
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,494
as you are doing purchases.


1714
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,796
With Transit, we are
supporting, of course,


1715
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:57,599
the mass transit capabilities
in Maps now, so you will be able


1716
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:59,467
to see the transit
lines on your wrist.


1717
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:01,102
You can actually see
the departure times


1718
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,704
for different stations
you are near.


1719
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:05,407
When you are navigating, you
will get step-by-step directions


1720
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:08,410
about getting through the
different mass transit you use.


1721
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,580
With Siri, we are continuing
to add new domains for Siri.


1722
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,782
In watchOS 2, we
are enabling Siri


1723
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:16,184
to get you mass transit
directions, like bus directions


1724
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,953
to the Ferry Building,
which will look like this


1725
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:19,654
and you can just
start navigating.


1726
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:22,390
Or you can control things
in your home with Siri,


1727
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,093
you can say things like "hey
Siri set the dinner scene,"


1728
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,562
and it will talk to any
HomeKit-enabled devices


1729
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:30,532
in your house and set the
lights just how you want them.


1730
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,834
Isn't that cool?


1731
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,669
It's going to be great.


1732
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:38,206
[Applause]


1733
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,375
Another great thing is you
can actually ask for any


1734
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,011
of the Glances you have,
so you can say "hey, Siri,


1735
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:45,180
show me the Instagram
Glance," and it will show


1736
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,514
up right on your Watch face.


1737
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:49,017
This could be a glance you
don't have currently selected.


1738
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:50,885
It's a great way
to show information


1739
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:54,456
from third-party apps
right there in Siri.


1740
01:29:54,456 --> 01:29:55,890
So those are just
some of the highlights


1741
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,325
of what's coming in watchOS 2.


1742
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:58,326
We think it's going
to be a really,


1743
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:01,429
really great update
to the Watch.


1744
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:02,697
Now, that's not all.


1745
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:06,635
[Applause]


1746
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:09,938
We also, of course, focused on
what we can do for developers,


1747
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:12,907
and already, out of the gate
on day one, you can build apps


1748
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,210
for Apple Watch using
something called WatchKit,


1749
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:19,147
and that has enabled many
thousands of apps now


1750
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:22,384
to be created for Apple Watch,
and these apps today function


1751
01:30:22,384 --> 01:30:24,019
by relying on your phone.


1752
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:26,154
So you might have, for
example, an app on your Watch


1753
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,256
and the user interface
runs on your phone


1754
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,892
and the user interface is on
your Watch, but all the logic


1755
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:33,328
for your app today
runs on your phone.


1756
01:30:33,328 --> 01:30:35,964
With native apps, you will
be able to move that logic


1757
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:38,667
to the watch so both the
UI and the logic are there,


1758
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:41,303
it will all run locally,
performance will be great,


1759
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:42,671
responsiveness will be great,


1760
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,040
it's going to be a great new
frontier for apps on Apple Watch


1761
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,741
with native app support.


1762
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:53,214
[Applause]


1763
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:56,117
When you are actually wandering
away from your phone sometimes,


1764
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,686
your apps will be able
to communicate directly


1765
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:59,721
with the network with
known Wi-Fi networks,


1766
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:01,690
so you can get the information
you want wherever you are


1767
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,758
with your Watch.


1768
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:07,929
[Applause]


1769
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:10,065
So we heard from you as we
were working on native apps,


1770
01:31:10,065 --> 01:31:11,866
a lot of feature requests
of things you would


1771
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,001
like to do on the Watch.


1772
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:15,003
These are a bunch of the
things that we've heard.


1773
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:16,471
So we've been listening to that.


1774
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,073
Let's go through
some of the things


1775
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:20,241
that will be possible
now in watchOS 2.


1776
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,643
You can see how we did on this.


1777
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,079
So one of the things we
heard was really wanted


1778
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:26,614
to access the microphone
on the Watch.


1779
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,417
So yes, in watchOS 2, you can
access the microphone right


1780
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:32,787
on the Watch and bring that
audio right into your app.


1781
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:35,824
[Applause]


1782
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,259
We also heard you want to
play audio out of the speaker.


1783
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,394
You can do that.


1784
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:40,929
WatchOS 2 with native
apps, you can play back


1785
01:31:40,929 --> 01:31:43,498
through the Watch speaker
or you can play audio


1786
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,567
to a Bluetooth headset
or speaker connected,


1787
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:47,936
both short-form and
long-form audio.


1788
01:31:47,936 --> 01:31:49,704
Video. We know you
wanted to play video.


1789
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:52,107
You can play back short-form
video right on the Watch face.


1790
01:31:52,107 --> 01:31:55,143
It looks beautiful
on the Watch display.


1791
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:56,745
Access to HealthKit.


1792
01:31:56,745 --> 01:31:58,079
We definitely heard that.


1793
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,782
You now will have access,
native HealthKit on the watch,


1794
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:03,485
including streaming heart rate
data, so if you are doing,


1795
01:32:03,485 --> 01:32:05,286
for example, a bike
ride with Strava,


1796
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:08,823
you can see what heart rate zone
you are in while you are biking.


1797
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:14,195
[Applause]


1798
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,865
HomeKit is natively on the Watch
so you will be able to talk


1799
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:19,367
to your HomeKit devices from
your Watch and control them.


1800
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,835
We think this is going
to be a great future


1801
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,103
for control right
from your wrist.


1802
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:24,873
You will be able to
access the Accelerometer


1803
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,374
so you can get movement data.


1804
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,310
So for example, from the iPING
golf app here, you can check


1805
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,012
out your golf swing tempo


1806
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:34,682
as you are swinging the golf
club with your Watch on.


1807
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:37,819
Taptic Engine is one of the
things we've really done a lot


1808
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:40,488
of focused work on to make it a
great experience on the wrist.


1809
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:43,024
We are bringing access to
the Taptic Engine for you


1810
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:44,492
for your app development.


1811
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:47,061
You will be able to choose from
a range of different feelings


1812
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,431
as well as audio that
will come out the speaker.


1813
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:51,766
So for example, if I am
unlocking my car here,


1814
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,869
I will get feedback on my
wrist, both audio and felt.


1815
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:57,639
Just like that.


1816
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:00,675
Another great interaction on the
Watch is using the Digital Crown


1817
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:04,012
to manipulate the UI, and we are
enabling access to Digital Crown


1818
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:05,180
as well with watchOS 2.


1819
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,116
You will be able to
control custom UI element


1820
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:09,818
like changing the
temperature here just


1821
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:11,820
by rotating the Crown like this.


1822
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,889
Super easy way to
interact with your Watch.


1823
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:20,128
[Applause]


1824
01:33:20,128 --> 01:33:22,130
So we've done a great job
bringing a lot of access


1825
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,565
to the Watch now
with native apps.


1826
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:26,901
I would like to show you a
demo now with some examples.


1827
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:31,539
[Applause]


1828
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:34,476
So I've got a Watch here,
and I am going to put it on.


1829
01:33:34,476 --> 01:33:37,779
It's connected to the display
here through this little cable.


1830
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,547
All right.


1831
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:43,852
Let's start by looking at
three examples of new features


1832
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:46,788
in watchOS 2, then I
will show you three apps.


1833
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,890
Let's start with
making a photo face,


1834
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:52,994
so I will press my Digital Crown
here, go to the Home screen.


1835
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,128
There's my Photos.


1836
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,898
You can see I've got a
bunch of photos on here.


1837
01:33:56,898 --> 01:33:59,334
I can zoom in with
the Crown, pan around,


1838
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:00,535
and I can pick a photo


1839
01:34:00,535 --> 01:34:03,037
that might make a nice
Watch face like that one.


1840
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:04,506
I want to zoom in and
crop it a little more.


1841
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:06,875
I am going to zoom in a
little more, move it over like


1842
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,176
that to get it just right.


1843
01:34:08,176 --> 01:34:10,245
I think that's going to
make a great Watch face,


1844
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:13,848
so I just Force Touch,
choose Create Watch Face,


1845
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:15,950
and there you go, a
beautiful new Watch face.


1846
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:21,389
[Applause]


1847
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,323
Let's look at Time Travel.


1848
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,025
I will go over to
my modular face,


1849
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,527
got some more information here.


1850
01:34:25,527 --> 01:34:27,295
I have flight times
here on United.


1851
01:34:27,295 --> 01:34:28,596
I can see the temperature,


1852
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:31,866
my VW car's charge
level, and time in London.


1853
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:35,236
So I just rotate the Crown
here, I can go forward in time.


1854
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:36,504
Time is updating.


1855
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,740
My flight is leaving,
you can see, at 1:45.


1856
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:41,709
I wonder if my charge level will
be enough to get to the airport.


1857
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:45,246
So if I keep going forward in
time here, we will get to 1:45,


1858
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,315
and you can see my charge
level is just going to be great


1859
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:48,783
to get to the airport.


1860
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:50,818
In fact, you can keep going
and look at boarding time


1861
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:52,053
and arrival time
for your flight.


1862
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,088
So you can get a great
preview of your day just


1863
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:56,090
by rotating the Crown
right on the Watch face.


1864
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,426
It's a lot of fun.


1865
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:01,062
Just press the Crown
and go back to Home.


1866
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:04,566
If you get an email, you can
reply to email now in watchOS 2.


1867
01:35:04,566 --> 01:35:08,236
Here is an email that's
just come in from Marc.


1868
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:10,805
I can reply to this by pressing
the button right below the


1869
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:13,241
message, or you can
use Siri to reply


1870
01:35:13,241 --> 01:35:15,677
to a message right
from a notification.


1871
01:35:15,677 --> 01:35:20,682
If I just use Siri here,
I can reply like this.


1872
01:35:20,682 --> 01:35:28,690
Reply: I would love to.


1873
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:30,825
So Siri is making
the message there.


1874
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:32,160
It's created a response.


1875
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,996
I just press Send, and
it now goes off to Marc.


1876
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,965
So just by pressing the
Crown, you can use Siri


1877
01:35:36,965 --> 01:35:39,434
to send a message
right from your wrist.


1878
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:41,269
Now, let's look at a
few third-party apps.


1879
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:44,272
Let's look at the VW app you
saw on slides a second ago.


1880
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:46,441
I will show you how that works.


1881
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:49,077
Here it is.


1882
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:50,478
Now, I can lock my car just


1883
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:52,180
by pressing this
control right here.


1884
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:54,148
It responds right away.


1885
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:55,817
You can see the app also
opened very quickly.


1886
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:57,652
And I can control
the temperature here


1887
01:35:57,652 --> 01:36:00,188
that we were looking at before
by just rotating the Crown.


1888
01:36:00,188 --> 01:36:02,123
You can see how responsive
it is as I go up and down


1889
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:02,890
through temperatures here.


1890
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,258
Really, really cool.


1891
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:06,160
I will get it nice and warm for
me so when I get down there,


1892
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,495
it will be nice and toasty.


1893
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:08,496
Okay. Turn it on.


1894
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:10,565
All right.


1895
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:12,634
I've got confirmation
that it actually enabled


1896
01:36:12,634 --> 01:36:14,202
that on my car now.


1897
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:16,971
Access to the mic is going
to be really helpful in apps,


1898
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:18,940
and some of the apps that will
really benefit are communication


1899
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,308
apps like We Chat.


1900
01:36:20,308 --> 01:36:23,511
A lot of messages sent via
WeChat are audio messages,


1901
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:26,748
so let's see how that
will work with watchOS 2.


1902
01:36:26,748 --> 01:36:29,250
I have a message from Becky.


1903
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:32,220
I can reply by pressing
the Reply button,


1904
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,788
and you can see I've
got a microphone now


1905
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,523
so I can do an audio response.


1906
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:37,892
Let's do that.


1907
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:41,195
That sounds great.


1908
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:44,599
You can see as I was recording
it, it got the audio levels


1909
01:36:44,599 --> 01:36:47,168
of my voice and now
it sent that to Becky.


1910
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:48,870
I can also reply
with stickers here.


1911
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,905
There's different
categories of them.


1912
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:54,308
With the Digital Crown now
being able to connect to the UI,


1913
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:57,745
I can flip through recent
stickers, pick one quickly


1914
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:00,448
that I like, and just
send that one as well.


1915
01:37:00,448 --> 01:37:02,116
So very fast to interact now


1916
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:05,386
with all these new controls you
have available in watchOS 2.


1917
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:07,922
Now, let's look at
the Vine glance.


1918
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:11,993
Vine is a great example of
playing back video on the Watch,


1919
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:15,363
and its format is really
perfect for the Watch face.


1920
01:37:15,363 --> 01:37:18,399
Here is a recent one on Vine.


1921
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,176
So that's video playing back
right on the Watch face.


1922
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:30,812
So those are just some
examples of what you can do now


1923
01:37:30,812 --> 01:37:32,980
with watchOS 2, and
I am super excited


1924
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:35,149
to see what all you guys
do with all this stuff.


1925
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:43,624
[Applause]


1926
01:37:43,624 --> 01:37:45,093
So some great new
enhancements coming,


1927
01:37:45,093 --> 01:37:48,296
as well as some super powerful
app development tools for you.


1928
01:37:48,296 --> 01:37:50,198
And we've been working
really hard on this,


1929
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:53,067
and I am really happy to say
that this stuff is all available


1930
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:56,170
to you today to start
building these native apps.


1931
01:37:56,170 --> 01:38:00,374
[Applause]


1932
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:02,677
Just six weeks from our
launch, it's unbelievable.


1933
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:06,013
Then it will be available
in the fall to everyone,


1934
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:07,582
and we will work
across all the watches,


1935
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:10,084
of course, and it will be free.


1936
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:11,753
So this has been
a great adventure.


1937
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:13,755
We are just getting
started here,


1938
01:38:13,755 --> 01:38:15,890
and I am really looking forward
to the journey ahead with all


1939
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,225
of you on Apple Watch.


1940
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:18,025
Thank you very much.


1941
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:19,060
Back to Tim.


1942
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,429
[Applause]


1943
01:38:21,429 --> 01:38:22,230
Thank you, Tim.


1944
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:26,234
>> TIM COOK: Thanks,
Kevin.


1945
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:28,836
We're really excited to have
Apple Watch out in the world,


1946
01:38:28,836 --> 01:38:32,907
and we can't wait to see
what you do with watchOS.


1947
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:36,778
And we couldn't be more
excited about how developers


1948
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:41,449
and users will use the powerful
ecosystems of both products


1949
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:46,954
and platforms, three
amazing platforms.


1950
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:50,992
The opportunities
really are limitless.


1951
01:38:50,992 --> 01:39:00,067
Now, before we close this
morning, we do have ...


1952
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:02,236
one more thing.


1953
01:39:02,236 --> 01:39:08,743
[Cheers and applause]


1954
01:39:08,743 --> 01:39:11,345
I'd like to tell
you about something


1955
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:13,548
that we've been working
really hard on


1956
01:39:13,548 --> 01:39:17,051
and something we are
super excited about.


1957
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:22,023
You know, we love music, and
music is such an important part


1958
01:39:22,023 --> 01:39:26,093
of our lives and our culture.


1959
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:30,431
We've had a long relationship
with music at Apple,


1960
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:34,068
and music has had a very
rich history of change,


1961
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,804
some of which we've
played a part in.


1962
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:40,541
We've made a great video
about the history of music,


1963
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:44,212
and I would like to play
it for you this morning.


1964
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:59,360
[Music]


1965
01:41:17,872 --> 01:41:23,477
[Cheers and applause]


1966
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:26,514
>> TIM COOK: Today we're
announcing Apple Music,


1967
01:41:26,514 --> 01:41:31,118
the next chapter in music, and
I know you are going to love it.


1968
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:35,690
It will change the way that
you experience music forever.


1969
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:40,027
To tell you more about it,
I'd like to bring up someone


1970
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:42,063
who knows more about music


1971
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:46,267
and the music experience
than anyone I know.


1972
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:50,838
He's worked with amazing
artists from Bruce Springsteen


1973
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:54,342
to John Lennon and
countless others.


1974
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:58,512
We are thrilled to have him
a part of the Apple team.


1975
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:00,948
Please join me in
welcoming Jimmy Iovine.


1976
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,416
Jimmy.


1977
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:10,958
[Cheers and applause]


1978
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,660
>> JIMMY IOVINE:
Thanks, Tim.


1979
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:15,062
Well, it's really
an honor to be here.


1980
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:17,098
I'm here because in 2003,


1981
01:42:17,098 --> 01:42:21,002
the record industry was
a ball of confusion.


1982
01:42:21,002 --> 01:42:26,340
We had Napster, we had
LimeWire, we had BitTorrent.


1983
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:30,745
This giant invader from
the north, technology.


1984
01:42:30,745 --> 01:42:34,448
I'm looking at my guys saying,
well, what do we do with this?


1985
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:37,718
So I go up to Apple, and I
see Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue,


1986
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:42,957
and they showed me something
brilliant and groundbreaking,


1987
01:42:42,957 --> 01:42:49,764
a simple, elegant way to
buy music online, iTunes.


1988
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:54,201
I'm like, wow, the ads are real.


1989
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:57,405
These guys really
do think different.


1990
01:42:57,405 --> 01:43:04,111
[Laughter] So they could help
move culture the same way


1991
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:06,714
that art moves culture.


1992
01:43:06,714 --> 01:43:13,954
Technology and art can work
together, at least at Apple.


1993
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:20,728
So now 2015, music industry
is a fragmented mess.


1994
01:43:20,728 --> 01:43:24,465
If you want to stream
music, you can go over here.


1995
01:43:24,465 --> 01:43:28,202
If you want to stream
some video,


1996
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:30,738
you can check some
of these places out.


1997
01:43:30,738 --> 01:43:32,706
If you want to follow
some artist,


1998
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:37,111
there's more confusion for that.


1999
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:42,116
So I reached out to Tim Cook
and Eddy Cue, and I said guys,


2000
01:43:42,116 --> 01:43:48,456
can we build a bigger and better
ecosystem with the elegance


2001
01:43:48,456 --> 01:43:52,760
and simplicity that
only Apple can do?


2002
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:57,698
One complete thought
around music.


2003
01:43:57,698 --> 01:44:01,302
And from that, I'm
standing here today so proud


2004
01:44:01,302 --> 01:44:05,039
of everyone that's worked
so hard, and I am going


2005
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:08,542
to introduce you to Apple Music.


2006
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:13,080
[Applause]


2007
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,182
>> Music has such
power in our lives.


2008
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:16,884
The way we listen to


2009
01:44:16,884 --> 01:44:21,455
and experience music is
undergoing a profound change


2010
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:22,656
these days.


2011
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:24,058
To have access to nearly
all the music in the world


2012
01:44:24,058 --> 01:44:27,094
at our fingertips and in
our pockets is remarkable.


2013
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:29,830
And yet there needs
to be a place


2014
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:31,999
where music can be treated
less like digital bits


2015
01:44:31,999 --> 01:44:34,101
and more like the art it is,


2016
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:37,872
with a sense of respect
and discovery.


2017
01:44:37,872 --> 01:44:39,607
And if that place could
actually accommodate


2018
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:41,642
and support the artists
who make the music,


2019
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:43,177
not just the top-tier artists,


2020
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:46,614
but the kids in their
bedrooms too, provide them all


2021
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:49,683
with a home and a way to
engage with their audiences,


2022
01:44:49,683 --> 01:44:52,119
that would be pretty great.


2023
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,588
And that's what we set out
to do with Apple Music.


2024
01:44:54,588 --> 01:45:00,361
[Music]


2025
01:45:00,361 --> 01:45:03,397
>> On Apple Music, all the
ways you love music can now


2026
01:45:03,397 --> 01:45:05,299
live together.


2027
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:08,035
Stream from the millions
of songs on iTunes any time


2028
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:11,071
and on demand, along with
hand-picked playlists,


2029
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,407
recommendations,
and all that's great


2030
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:16,177
and breaking in music right now.


2031
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:20,781
And broadcasting every day is
Apple's first 24/7 worldwide


2032
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:24,885
radio station, live
in over 100 countries,


2033
01:45:24,885 --> 01:45:27,655
Beats 1 is anchored
by Zane Lowe in LA.


2034
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:29,924
Ero Dodden in New York.


2035
01:45:29,924 --> 01:45:32,359
>> New York City
worldwide, this is Beats 1.


2036
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:34,161
>> And me, Julie out of
London.


2037
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:38,365
>> We cannot wait to play you
guys music we've got lined up.


2038
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:42,436
>> And at the heart of Apple
Music, there's Connect,


2039
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:45,739
where artists can share
with fans like never before.


2040
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:48,809
Songs, remixes, demos,
mix tapes, photos,


2041
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:52,012
videos, lyrics, soundbites.


2042
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:56,183
Really, any way an artist
chooses to express themselves.


2043
01:45:57,284 --> 01:45:58,886
>> TRENT REZNOR:
For fans,


2044
01:45:58,886 --> 01:46:00,721
we tried to create a
complete experience,


2045
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:03,457
by combining the catalog
of the world's music


2046
01:46:03,457 --> 01:46:05,459
with the music that's
not in that catalog yet,


2047
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,661
direct from the artist to you


2048
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:09,196
in a shared experience
with Beats 1.


2049
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:12,933
For the artists, we've built
an ecosystem we hope can start


2050
01:46:12,933 --> 01:46:16,737
to provide the tools to grow,
nurture, and sustain careers.


2051
01:46:16,737 --> 01:46:21,675
One place, one complete
thought around music.


2052
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:26,180
[Music]


2053
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,214
[Cheers and applause]


2054
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,316
>> JIMMY IOVINE:
Thank you.


2055
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:35,489
That's Apple Music and
the great Trent Reznor.


2056
01:46:35,489 --> 01:46:38,425
It's all the ways you love
music all in one place.


2057
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:42,096
And that place is
almost in a billion hands


2058
01:46:42,096 --> 01:46:43,797
around the world already.


2059
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:49,803
One app, one single
app on your iPhone.


2060
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:52,406
Apple Music is three things.


2061
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:57,411
It's a revolutionary
music service.


2062
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:02,049
Oh. A revolutionary
music service curated


2063
01:47:02,049 --> 01:47:06,687
by the leading music experts
who we helped hand-pick.


2064
01:47:06,687 --> 01:47:08,555
These people are
going to help you


2065
01:47:08,555 --> 01:47:10,891
with the most difficult
question in music.


2066
01:47:10,891 --> 01:47:15,129
When you are listening to a
playlist, what song comes next?


2067
01:47:15,129 --> 01:47:17,731
The only song that's
as important


2068
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:19,466
as the one you are
listening to at


2069
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:22,503
that moment is the
one that follows it.


2070
01:47:22,503 --> 01:47:23,971
Now, picture this.


2071
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:29,376
You are in a special moment.


2072
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:33,814
You're exercising or some
other special moment.


2073
01:47:33,814 --> 01:47:34,982
[Laughter] Right, Dre?


2074
01:47:34,982 --> 01:47:38,152
He exercises a lot.


2075
01:47:38,152 --> 01:47:40,754
And your heart's pumping.


2076
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:42,923
And you are about
to turn up the reps.


2077
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:46,794
And the next song
comes on, ehhh!


2078
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:48,028
Buzz kill.


2079
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:50,964
You may ask why that happened.


2080
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:53,801
It happened because it
was probably programmed


2081
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:56,170
by an algorithm alone.


2082
01:47:56,170 --> 01:48:00,274
Algorithms alone can't
do that emotional task.


2083
01:48:00,274 --> 01:48:03,243
You need a human touch, and
that's why at Apple Music,


2084
01:48:03,243 --> 01:48:06,046
we want to give you the right
song, the right playlist,


2085
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:09,316
at the right moment,
all on demand.


2086
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:16,924
Now, the first-ever live
24-hour worldwide radio station,


2087
01:48:16,924 --> 01:48:20,461
so Trent Reznor calls
me up and says I got it.


2088
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:22,429
This is what we're going to do.


2089
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:27,735
Let's build the first-ever
worldwide live radio station


2090
01:48:27,735 --> 01:48:32,206
broadcast from three cities
that plays music not based


2091
01:48:32,206 --> 01:48:39,346
on research, not based on
genre, not based on drum beats,


2092
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:45,386
only music that is
great and feels great.


2093
01:48:45,386 --> 01:48:50,691
A station that has only
one master, music itself.


2094
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:54,728
So I said why do artists
always have the greatest ideas


2095
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:58,866
that are practically
impossible to execute?


2096
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,668
So I said, well, wait a second.


2097
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:03,470
That's why we are at Apple.


2098
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:07,141
We are at Apple to help
artists' dreams be realized.


2099
01:49:07,141 --> 01:49:13,914
So we built the station, and
it's a music lover's dream.


2100
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:17,851
If you love great music without
any restrictions, you are going


2101
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:21,922
to love Apple Music's Beats 1.


2102
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:26,293
Finally, Connect, a fantastic
way for established and new


2103
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:29,630
and even unsigned artists
to connect directly


2104
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:32,599
with music lovers anywhere.


2105
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:35,803
This is going to be very
powerful for musicians.


2106
01:49:35,803 --> 01:49:38,439
Can you imagine being
an up-and-coming artist


2107
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:41,775
and being able to
share your music


2108
01:49:41,775 --> 01:49:44,244
on the biggest music
platform on the world


2109
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:48,816
that people already
have, Apple Music?


2110
01:49:48,816 --> 01:49:51,685
Remember, this is an ecosystem.


2111
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:53,921
It's built to fit together.


2112
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:56,223
It feeds off each other.


2113
01:49:56,223 --> 01:49:57,791
When you upload your music


2114
01:49:57,791 --> 01:50:02,563
to Apple Music, anything
can happen.


2115
01:50:02,563 --> 01:50:05,966
So now let me leave
the real heavy lifting


2116
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:08,335
to my great friend, Eddy Cue,


2117
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:10,904
and tell you how this
all works together.


2118
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:18,545
[Cheers and applause]


2119
01:50:18,545 --> 01:50:20,214
>> EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Jimmy.


2120
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:22,616
It's great to be here
this morning with you.


2121
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,953
So Apple Music, it's a
revolutionary music service,


2122
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,455
and it starts with My Music.


2123
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:30,791
We've added some great new
features from iTunes like the


2124
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:35,362
Up Next queue, and also
your recently added albums


2125
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:36,964
and songs right across the top.


2126
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:39,333
And all of the music
you've purchased,


2127
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:41,969
along with the playlists
you've created on your Mac


2128
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:44,872
or your iPhone, are right here.


2129
01:50:44,872 --> 01:50:47,574
Now, of course, you can
search your music library,


2130
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:50,978
but now you can search and
stream the millions and millions


2131
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:54,748
of songs that we have on iTunes.


2132
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:58,685
Now, in addition to My Music,
when you can stream and listen


2133
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:02,389
to any song you want, you
need a great place to start,


2134
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:05,692
and that's why we've
created For You.


2135
01:51:05,692 --> 01:51:08,295
For You recommends
playlists and albums


2136
01:51:08,295 --> 01:51:10,497
that we think you
are going to love.


2137
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:12,499
They are personalized
to your taste based


2138
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:15,402
on the music you listen
to, the artists you love.


2139
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:19,806
And it isn't just algorithms.


2140
01:51:19,806 --> 01:51:23,610
It's recommendations made by
real people who love music,


2141
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:26,446
and they are our
team of experts.


2142
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:28,048
Now, let's take a look at New.


2143
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:31,518
Here you will discover new
artists and albums every week,


2144
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:35,122
along with the top charts, and
every one of our playlists,


2145
01:51:35,122 --> 01:51:41,061
all human-curated, available
by genre or by activity.


2146
01:51:41,061 --> 01:51:43,797
So when you think
of Apple Music,


2147
01:51:43,797 --> 01:51:48,201
it's My Music, For You and New.


2148
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:50,003
It makes it fun and easy


2149
01:51:50,003 --> 01:51:53,707
to experience the catalog
of the world's music.


2150
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:56,677
And that is the revolutionary
music service.


2151
01:51:56,677 --> 01:51:58,879
Now let's talk about Radio.


2152
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:02,583
The truth is Internet
radio isn't really radio.


2153
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:04,217
It's just a playlist of songs.


2154
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:07,554
And so we wanted to do
something really big.


2155
01:52:07,554 --> 01:52:11,525
We wanted to create a worldwide
live radio station broadcasting


2156
01:52:11,525 --> 01:52:15,729
around the globe, and we've
done that with Beats 1.


2157
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:18,732
It's the world's best radio
station now meets the world's


2158
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:22,970
best voice, and that's
why we've hired Zane Lowe.


2159
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:27,174
Zane is a masterful interviewer
and an influential music figure


2160
01:52:27,174 --> 01:52:31,745
in his own right, and to tell
you more about it, here is Zane.


2161
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:36,183
>> ZANE LOWE: I am a
music fan.


2162
01:52:36,183 --> 01:52:38,018
I play records.


2163
01:52:38,018 --> 01:52:40,554
What I love is watching
a group of people react


2164
01:52:40,554 --> 01:52:43,523
to a great record
for the first time.


2165
01:52:43,523 --> 01:52:46,460
When I play that record on the
radio, the audience tell me,


2166
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,961
the time lines light up,


2167
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:50,597
my friends tell me,
my phone lights up.


2168
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:53,100
They love it or they hate it.


2169
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,968
But it creates a debate.


2170
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:58,105
That's what good music
on the radio does.


2171
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:00,807
When Apple first asked me to be
involved in this, they told us


2172
01:53:00,807 --> 01:53:04,811
to put the great music in front
of the average, the unexpected,


2173
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:08,815
the undiscovered, the
anticipated, the underrated.


2174
01:53:08,815 --> 01:53:10,951
Their words: Move the needle.


2175
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,253
And that's what we are doing.


2176
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:16,156
We have real music fans
running this place.


2177
01:53:16,156 --> 01:53:19,660
We have great music DJs and
incredible artists who are


2178
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:22,896
in the studio right now
building real radio shows


2179
01:53:22,896 --> 01:53:24,598
that are going to
blow your mind.


2180
01:53:24,598 --> 01:53:28,402
And the only place that can
pull off an imaginative idea


2181
01:53:28,402 --> 01:53:30,537
as big as this -- Apple.


2182
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,572
We are called Beats 1.


2183
01:53:32,572 --> 01:53:38,245
We are always on, playing
the music that we love.


2184
01:53:38,245 --> 01:53:42,382
[Applause]


2185
01:53:42,382 --> 01:53:44,184
>> EDDY CUE: So
Beats 1.


2186
01:53:44,184 --> 01:53:48,021
It is worldwide, it is live,
it is broadcasting 24 by 7,


2187
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:50,090
and it is coming
from New York, LA,


2188
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:54,027
and London, and that is Radio.


2189
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:57,330
Next, we wanted to find a
way to bring fans closer


2190
01:53:57,330 --> 01:54:00,100
to the artists they love,
and we call it Connect.


2191
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:05,639
It's a place where artists are
free to upload their music,


2192
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:11,111
their videos, their photos,
all directly to a fan.


2193
01:54:11,111 --> 01:54:15,248
Let's take Pharrell, a favorite
musician and songwriter of mine.


2194
01:54:15,248 --> 01:54:18,819
He is prolific, and
he does a lot.


2195
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:21,088
Let me show you how
it works with Connect.


2196
01:54:21,088 --> 01:54:23,156
He takes a lot of photos.


2197
01:54:23,156 --> 01:54:25,325
He writes a lot of lyrics.


2198
01:54:25,325 --> 01:54:28,495
He's experimenting and
mixing songs all the time.


2199
01:54:28,495 --> 01:54:32,132
Or he just has something
new and interesting to say.


2200
01:54:32,132 --> 01:54:35,602
All of this lives
right in Connect.


2201
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:39,940
Artists can post and
publish and upload anything,


2202
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:43,410
including directly to Facebook,
Twitter, and their own website,


2203
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:48,415
and fans can like and
comment on those posts.


2204
01:54:48,415 --> 01:54:51,451
And it's not just for one
artist, but it's for all


2205
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:53,453
of the artists that you love.


2206
01:54:53,453 --> 01:54:55,422
And to give you a
little sense of what it's


2207
01:54:55,422 --> 01:54:58,525
like to be an artist on Connect,


2208
01:54:58,525 --> 01:55:02,195
I'd like to invite
up a friend, Drake.


2209
01:55:02,195 --> 01:55:11,271
[Cheers and applause]


2210
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:18,612
>> DRAKE:
Thank you.


2211
01:55:18,612 --> 01:55:25,018
I want to say, honestly, what an
honor it is to be in this room


2212
01:55:25,018 --> 01:55:27,454
with so many individuals
that have changed the way


2213
01:55:27,454 --> 01:55:29,122
in which the world
relates to technology,


2214
01:55:29,122 --> 01:55:31,224
so give yourselves a
round of applause, please.


2215
01:55:31,224 --> 01:55:35,762
[Applause]


2216
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:41,168
For example, I bought this
vintage Apple employee's jacket


2217
01:55:41,168 --> 01:55:44,905
using a tool known in the
rap world as the Internet.


2218
01:55:44,905 --> 01:55:47,507
It's going to be huge this year.


2219
01:55:47,507 --> 01:55:48,842
It's out of this world.


2220
01:55:48,842 --> 01:55:50,977
He is excited, he knows about
it, that guy right there.


2221
01:55:50,977 --> 01:55:53,980
[Laughter] Honestly, in all
seriousness, I came here today


2222
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:58,084
to share my story, about the
way technology changed what I do


2223
01:55:58,084 --> 01:55:58,852
for a living.


2224
01:55:58,852 --> 01:56:02,255
I am from Toronto, Canada.


2225
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:06,760
[Cheers and applause]


2226
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:09,095
[Laughter]


2227
01:56:09,095 --> 01:56:12,499
You know, as a kid growing up,
I always wondered if my city


2228
01:56:12,499 --> 01:56:16,403
or even my country would
have somebody break


2229
01:56:16,403 --> 01:56:19,339
into the global music
scene as a true superstar.


2230
01:56:19,339 --> 01:56:23,743
You know, the dream seemed
unattainable at the time.


2231
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:26,546
Even myself, I tried to
do it the traditional way,


2232
01:56:26,546 --> 01:56:31,484
the towering New York label
buildings, the lobby littered


2233
01:56:31,484 --> 01:56:34,888
with other people's
accomplishments.


2234
01:56:34,888 --> 01:56:37,724
It's improbable to think that
every talented artist is going


2235
01:56:37,724 --> 01:56:40,460
to get a shot to have
their vision validated.


2236
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:44,998
And then that's when
the game changed.


2237
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:47,601
And we had to change it.


2238
01:56:47,601 --> 01:56:52,539
Myself and my team
brought our vision


2239
01:56:52,539 --> 01:56:54,941
and our music directly
to the people.


2240
01:56:54,941 --> 01:57:02,849
And that was kind of the first
time that we really got noticed.


2241
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:08,588
The dream of being a new artist
like myself five years ago


2242
01:57:08,588 --> 01:57:11,491
and connecting directly with
an audience has never been more


2243
01:57:11,491 --> 01:57:14,461
close and reachable
than right now.


2244
01:57:14,461 --> 01:57:19,866
See, now we encourage you to
spend the time on your body


2245
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:24,437
of work, spend the time on your
craft, assemble the right body


2246
01:57:24,437 --> 01:57:26,806
of work, and instead of
having to post your stuff


2247
01:57:26,806 --> 01:57:31,044
on all these different and
sometimes confusing places,


2248
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:33,446
it all lives in one very simple,


2249
01:57:33,446 --> 01:57:37,651
very easy place,
and that is Connect.


2250
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:40,220
It's right from where
you are in your city


2251
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,355
in front of your computer.


2252
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:45,225
And this approach is
how we broke in 2008,


2253
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:48,395
and it has been perfected
and simplified, of course,


2254
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:51,298
by the great people at Apple.


2255
01:57:51,298 --> 01:57:57,470
So you know, as I'm working
tirelessly on this next album,


2256
01:57:57,470 --> 01:57:59,539
this comes at the
perfect time for me.


2257
01:57:59,539 --> 01:58:05,378
Given the great success of my
last mix tape that went directly


2258
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:07,447
to iTunes, this really --


2259
01:58:07,447 --> 01:58:14,120
I can't wait to incorporate
Apple Music


2260
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,022
and especially Connect
into what I am doing next.


2261
01:58:16,022 --> 01:58:17,791
I am really excited about
what I am working on.


2262
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:21,661
And as an artist, I can say for
all those kids sitting at home,


2263
01:58:21,661 --> 01:58:26,199
it's truly amazing to be part
of something that I believe in,


2264
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:31,671
and this is something
that simplifies everything


2265
01:58:31,671 --> 01:58:34,307
for the modern musician
like myself


2266
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:37,310
and the modern music
consumer like you.


2267
01:58:37,310 --> 01:58:39,045
So I hope you enjoy Apple Music.


2268
01:58:39,045 --> 01:58:40,180
I hope you enjoy Connect.


2269
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:41,948
My name is Drake, and
thank you for your time.


2270
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,416
Appreciate it.


2271
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:50,523
[Cheers and applause]


2272
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:53,259
>> EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Drake.


2273
01:58:53,259 --> 01:58:54,928
And that is Connect.


2274
01:58:54,928 --> 01:58:58,565
Now, I'd love to give you
a demo of Apple Music,


2275
01:58:58,565 --> 01:59:00,767
but before I start, I do want


2276
01:59:00,767 --> 01:59:04,437
to wish Phil Schiller
a happy birthday.


2277
01:59:04,437 --> 01:59:13,513
[Cheers and applause]


2278
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:20,453
So let's go ahead and
launch our new Music app.


2279
01:59:20,453 --> 01:59:22,689
You will notice right away
it's got a brand-new UI,


2280
01:59:22,689 --> 01:59:24,124
much simpler to use.


2281
01:59:24,124 --> 01:59:26,760
Your recently added albums and
songs right across the top.


2282
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:30,463
Let's play this new
song from Spoon I added.


2283
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:34,134
[Music]


2284
01:59:34,134 --> 01:59:35,201
One of the things
you will notice,


2285
01:59:35,201 --> 01:59:37,003
we have a new mini
player across the bottom


2286
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:39,005
that always shows
you what's playing.


2287
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:41,941
If I tap on it, I
get full screen,


2288
01:59:41,941 --> 01:59:44,010
and I can see the
beautiful artwork,


2289
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:45,445
all the playback controls.


2290
01:59:45,445 --> 01:59:51,618
I can just swipe down,
and it disappears.


2291
01:59:52,986 --> 01:59:55,588
Now, I like looking
at my music by artist.


2292
01:59:55,588 --> 01:59:56,723
It's really easy to do that too.


2293
01:59:56,723 --> 02:00:00,693
I will just tap on
Albums, switch to Artists,


2294
02:00:00,693 --> 02:00:02,295
and let's take a look
at Aretha Franklin.


2295
02:00:02,295 --> 02:00:05,331
The first thing you will notice
is we add beautiful artwork


2296
02:00:05,331 --> 02:00:07,333
to all the artist pages.


2297
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:09,602
Notice as I swipe
up, it goes away,


2298
02:00:09,602 --> 02:00:11,204
and you see Aretha at the top.


2299
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:15,442
No demo goes complete
without playing this song.


2300
02:00:16,509 --> 02:00:25,585
[Music]


2301
02:00:27,287 --> 02:00:30,623
Now, you not only get all of
your Aretha Franklin songs


2302
02:00:30,623 --> 02:00:33,560
in your music library, but
you can also tap on All,


2303
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,362
and now you can see all of
the songs on Apple Music,


2304
02:00:36,362 --> 02:00:39,799
including the latest
release, what the top song is,


2305
02:00:39,799 --> 02:00:42,769
what the top album is.


2306
02:00:42,769 --> 02:00:45,171
Now, it is hard to stop this
song, but I want to keep going.


2307
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:48,274
Now let's go back to my library,


2308
02:00:48,274 --> 02:00:50,910
and let's take a
look at my playlists.


2309
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:52,912
Now, despite the game last
night, I am getting ready


2310
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:54,881
for tomorrow night, and I
have already started creating


2311
02:00:54,881 --> 02:00:56,282
my playlist.


2312
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:58,051
One of the first things you will
notice is you can add your own


2313
02:00:58,051 --> 02:00:59,419
artwork to your playlist.


2314
02:00:59,419 --> 02:01:01,521
I am going to be
doing this tonight,


2315
02:01:01,521 --> 02:01:04,824
getting the Warriors
ready, but let's go back.


2316
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:09,996
It is karaoke night, and
these are some of the songs


2317
02:01:09,996 --> 02:01:12,599
that our team has to
look forward to tonight.


2318
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,134
Let's go ahead and play that.


2319
02:01:14,134 --> 02:01:16,202
[Music]


2320
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:17,570
Just imagine.


2321
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:22,075
[Music]


2322
02:01:22,075 --> 02:01:25,111
Now, if I tap on
the mini player,


2323
02:01:25,111 --> 02:01:27,180
I can see the full screen.


2324
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:30,116
If I tap on the right-hand side
next to the playback controls,


2325
02:01:30,116 --> 02:01:32,385
I can see the complete
playlist, and it's very easy


2326
02:01:32,385 --> 02:01:33,486
for me to reorganize it.


2327
02:01:33,486 --> 02:01:35,955
Let's say I want to
move Jealous back up,


2328
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:37,857
and now that will be the
next song that plays.


2329
02:01:37,857 --> 02:01:39,592
It's that simple.


2330
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:46,166
[Applause]


2331
02:01:46,166 --> 02:01:47,567
Now, that's great.


2332
02:01:47,567 --> 02:01:50,069
The first time we go to For You,
we want to find out a little bit


2333
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:51,971
about your musical
tastes, so we are going


2334
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,840
to ask you what genres you like.


2335
02:01:53,840 --> 02:02:01,748
I am a big fan of rock, pop,
hip-hop, and alternative.


2336
02:02:01,748 --> 02:02:06,252
And now it will ask me for
some artists that I like.


2337
02:02:06,252 --> 02:02:08,788
Well, I love Bruce Springsteen,
so I am going to tap twice.


2338
02:02:08,788 --> 02:02:13,526
I like Lorde, like
Alabama Shakes.


2339
02:02:13,526 --> 02:02:14,794
Now we are going to take all


2340
02:02:14,794 --> 02:02:17,397
of this information you've
provided, along with all


2341
02:02:17,397 --> 02:02:20,867
of your playlists and the songs
that you've purchased on iTunes,


2342
02:02:20,867 --> 02:02:23,736
and we are going to make
recommendations just for you.


2343
02:02:23,736 --> 02:02:27,040
So here is one inspired
by Bruce Springsteen.


2344
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,075
Here's one called
Bring the Big Rock.


2345
02:02:29,075 --> 02:02:30,643
Let's play that.


2346
02:02:30,643 --> 02:02:34,514
[Music]


2347
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:36,516
That's a great Foo
Fighters song.


2348
02:02:36,516 --> 02:02:40,353
I can just tap and see
the rest of the songs.


2349
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:42,488
Definitely going to
like this playlist.


2350
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:46,359
Now, here's another
one from Pharrell.


2351
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:48,995
I also get new albums
that are available to me,


2352
02:02:48,995 --> 02:02:51,331
and even some classic albums
that I should be listening to.


2353
02:02:51,331 --> 02:02:54,801
And so here are some
brand-new albums


2354
02:02:54,801 --> 02:02:56,936
from the artists
that I really love.


2355
02:02:56,936 --> 02:03:02,709
Now, here is an interesting
one, a Cuban playlist.


2356
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:04,177
You might be wondering
how did that get in there?


2357
02:03:04,177 --> 02:03:08,715
Well, I like a lot of Latin
music, so Apple Music knows that


2358
02:03:08,715 --> 02:03:10,183
and is recommending
this playlist to me.


2359
02:03:10,183 --> 02:03:12,752
Let's take a look at it.


2360
02:03:13,686 --> 02:03:20,560
[Music]


2361
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,695
Definitely gets my
Cuban blood going.


2362
02:03:22,695 --> 02:03:27,734
[Music]


2363
02:03:27,734 --> 02:03:30,903
Now, this is a playlist I
definitely want to keep,


2364
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:33,740
so I am going to tap on the
plus sign, and I've added


2365
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,408
that now to my playlist.


2366
02:03:35,408 --> 02:03:41,414
Now, let's take a
look at what's new.


2367
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:44,651
You can see new albums
across the top.


2368
02:03:44,651 --> 02:03:46,986
More here, and even the
hot singles that are out.


2369
02:03:46,986 --> 02:03:50,723
Let's play this one from
Florence and the Machine.


2370
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:59,799
[Music]


2371
02:04:01,734 --> 02:04:07,573
I can keep scrolling and
see some recent releases.


2372
02:04:07,573 --> 02:04:10,810
But of course, everyone loves
the charts, so let's go ahead


2373
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:15,214
and take a look at the
charts, see the top songs.


2374
02:04:15,214 --> 02:04:16,149
The top albums.


2375
02:04:16,149 --> 02:04:18,384
And even the top music videos.


2376
02:04:18,384 --> 02:04:22,488
We have tens of thousands of
music videos in HD, all ad-free.


2377
02:04:22,488 --> 02:04:25,358
Let's take a look at this
one from Mark Ronson.


2378
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:36,836
[Music]


2379
02:04:57,490 --> 02:05:00,293
I've got to work on some of
those moves for next year.


2380
02:05:01,627 --> 02:05:03,129
[Laughter] Now, sometimes
you just want to sit back


2381
02:05:03,129 --> 02:05:06,632
and let someone else be your
DJ, so let's go to Radio.


2382
02:05:06,632 --> 02:05:08,234
And to give you a little taste


2383
02:05:08,234 --> 02:05:11,003
of what Beats 1 is
going to sound like ...


2384
02:05:14,741 --> 02:05:15,508
>>
Beats 1.


2385
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:16,776
Welcome our special guest,


2386
02:05:16,776 --> 02:05:18,344
Florence from Florence
and the Machine.


2387
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:21,948
>> On paper, it sounds like
super, not how you think a rock


2388
02:05:21,948 --> 02:05:23,716
and roll album would be made.


2389
02:05:23,716 --> 02:05:25,251
>> Was that you in
your sweatpants?


2390
02:05:25,251 --> 02:05:29,389
>> That was me in an anorak
cycling to the studio.


2391
02:05:29,389 --> 02:05:31,724
>> We are looking for the
most exciting music and people


2392
02:05:31,724 --> 02:05:33,960
that love it in all
corners of the globe,


2393
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:35,962
broadcasting to 100 countries.


2394
02:05:35,962 --> 02:05:39,265
That shared experience
just got so much bigger.


2395
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:41,134
&gt;&gt
LA.


2396
02:05:41,134 --> 02:05:43,069
>> New York
City.


2397
02:05:43,069 --> 02:05:44,036
>>
London.


2398
02:05:44,036 --> 02:05:44,971
>> EDDY CUE: That's
really awesome.


2399
02:05:44,971 --> 02:05:46,205
Let's take a look at Connect


2400
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:49,575
and see what my favorite
artists are up to.


2401
02:05:49,575 --> 02:05:52,712
Here's Pharrell and some
behind-the-scenes footage.


2402
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:53,679
Here is Chris Cornell.


2403
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:55,581
This is an interesting one.


2404
02:05:55,581 --> 02:05:58,518
He has posted lyrics of a new
song that's coming out before,


2405
02:05:58,518 --> 02:06:00,686
obviously, he's even
recorded it.


2406
02:06:00,686 --> 02:06:02,488
Here's Bastille.


2407
02:06:02,488 --> 02:06:05,358
They are working on
their next album.


2408
02:06:05,358 --> 02:06:07,860
Let's see what they have to say.


2409
02:06:08,995 --> 02:06:10,963
>> Mark is just through
here, and we are working


2410
02:06:10,963 --> 02:06:13,800
on a song called Blame, which
some of you might have heard


2411
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:16,536
at festivals or gigs before,


2412
02:06:16,536 --> 02:06:19,705
but we're really excited to
have finally recorded it.


2413
02:06:19,705 --> 02:06:21,340
It's a song about gangsters.


2414
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,575
And yeah, this is the riff,


2415
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:25,878
which we already
have sounding great.


2416
02:06:25,878 --> 02:06:32,351
[Music]


2417
02:06:32,351 --> 02:06:34,287
>> EDDY CUE: It's great to be
able to get behind the scenes


2418
02:06:34,287 --> 02:06:37,089
and see what the process that
an artist uses to create a song.


2419
02:06:37,089 --> 02:06:40,526
As we keep going
down, here's a shot


2420
02:06:40,526 --> 02:06:43,396
from Alabama Shakes
a couple nights ago.


2421
02:06:43,396 --> 02:06:46,766
And here is a studio session,
actually, at Capital Studio A.


2422
02:06:46,766 --> 02:06:48,601
Those of you who know,
Capitol Studio is one


2423
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:51,137
of the premier studios,
historical,


2424
02:06:51,137 --> 02:06:53,906
and Alabama Shakes was just
there a couple nights ago.


2425
02:06:53,906 --> 02:07:02,982
[Music]


2426
02:07:18,064 --> 02:07:19,332
>> EDDY CUE: Again,
be able


2427
02:07:19,332 --> 02:07:22,635
to see things you've never
been able to hear or see.


2428
02:07:22,635 --> 02:07:25,838
Loren Kramar, you probably
have never heard of him.


2429
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:29,208
He is an unsigned artist, I
just started following him.


2430
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:31,844
He has posted a new song
right up on Connect,


2431
02:07:31,844 --> 02:07:33,546
and I would love to play it now.


2432
02:07:33,546 --> 02:07:36,949
First time anyone's heard it.


2433
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:43,489
[Music]


2434
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:44,657
Just imagine you
are a new artist,


2435
02:07:44,657 --> 02:07:46,659
and look at all the
people who have been able


2436
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:48,961
to hear this song right
now thanks to Connect.


2437
02:07:48,961 --> 02:07:58,037
[Music]


2438
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:05,044
So Loren Kramar.


2439
02:08:05,044 --> 02:08:06,345
Remember that name.


2440
02:08:06,345 --> 02:08:09,215
We think he is going to
be really, really huge.


2441
02:08:09,215 --> 02:08:11,918
Now, of course, you can always
search for music across all


2442
02:08:11,918 --> 02:08:13,319
of our millions and
millions of songs.


2443
02:08:13,319 --> 02:08:15,855
I like to do a little
bit of stuff with Siri


2444
02:08:15,855 --> 02:08:19,492
because Siri has been learning
a lot more about music.


2445
02:08:19,492 --> 02:08:22,361
Play Born to Run.


2446
02:08:25,998 --> 02:08:35,074
[Music]


2447
02:08:36,876 --> 02:08:38,578
It's one of my favorite
songs of all time.


2448
02:08:38,578 --> 02:08:39,979
Let's get a little
more specific.


2449
02:08:39,979 --> 02:08:44,550
Play the top ten
songs in Alternative.


2450
02:08:47,019 --> 02:08:56,095
[Music]


2451
02:08:58,397 --> 02:09:01,434
If I tap on the Up Next
queue, I can see all


2452
02:09:01,434 --> 02:09:04,437
of the top ten songs
and what's next.


2453
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:11,644
Now, I feel like reminiscing
a little, and let's go back


2454
02:09:11,644 --> 02:09:15,114
to my high school
days when I graduated.


2455
02:09:15,114 --> 02:09:19,585
Play the top song from May 1982.


2456
02:09:22,054 --> 02:09:31,130
[Music]


2457
02:09:40,139 --> 02:09:41,841
Now, that brings back some
memories, but we will leave


2458
02:09:41,841 --> 02:09:43,209
that for another time.


2459
02:09:43,209 --> 02:09:47,580
Have you ever gone to a movie
and you love the soundtrack


2460
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:50,583
or the song that was on there,
but you don't know the name


2461
02:09:50,583 --> 02:09:52,018
or you have forgotten
about it later?


2462
02:09:52,018 --> 02:09:55,321
Well, it's really
easy with Siri.


2463
02:09:55,321 --> 02:09:58,090
Play the song from Selma.


2464
02:10:03,095 --> 02:10:07,433
[Music]


2465
02:10:07,433 --> 02:10:10,336
Let's do that again.


2466
02:10:10,336 --> 02:10:12,638
Play the song from Selma.


2467
02:10:16,108 --> 02:10:25,184
[Music]


2468
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:36,128
And that is Siri, and
that is Apple Music.


2469
02:10:36,128 --> 02:10:39,999
[Cheers and applause]


2470
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:42,635
It is a revolutionary
music service


2471
02:10:42,635 --> 02:10:44,403
with recommendations
just for you,


2472
02:10:44,403 --> 02:10:48,207
a worldwide live radio station
with the world's best DJs,


2473
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:51,544
an exciting way for fans
to connect with artists,


2474
02:10:51,544 --> 02:10:54,814
and of course, this is joined
by the iTunes Music Store,


2475
02:10:54,814 --> 02:10:56,949
the best place to buy music.


2476
02:10:56,949 --> 02:10:59,852
Apple Music is all of
the ways you love music,


2477
02:10:59,852 --> 02:11:01,153
all in one place.


2478
02:11:01,153 --> 02:11:04,924
We are launching in over a
hundred countries later this


2479
02:11:04,924 --> 02:11:10,096
month with iOS 8.4 for your
iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad,


2480
02:11:10,096 --> 02:11:13,299
as well as a new version
of iTunes for the Mac,


2481
02:11:13,299 --> 02:11:15,668
a new version of
iTunes for Windows,


2482
02:11:15,668 --> 02:11:18,170
and Android is coming this fall.


2483
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:22,141
[Cheers and applause]


2484
02:11:22,141 --> 02:11:26,345
Apple Music will be just $9.99
a month, the cost of an album.


2485
02:11:26,345 --> 02:11:28,280
We want everyone to try it,


2486
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:31,183
so we are making the
first three months free.


2487
02:11:31,183 --> 02:11:37,623
[Applause]


2488
02:11:37,623 --> 02:11:40,559
Now, we want to do something
really great for families.


2489
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:42,795
Today you have to buy
a music subscription


2490
02:11:42,795 --> 02:11:44,997
for each and every person.


2491
02:11:44,997 --> 02:11:47,600
Or you share an account even
though you are not supposed to.


2492
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:51,103
And now all of you can't
play at the same time,


2493
02:11:51,103 --> 02:11:52,138
and your playlists


2494
02:11:52,138 --> 02:11:54,507
and recommendations
get all messed up.


2495
02:11:54,507 --> 02:11:59,445
Well, with Apple Music, for
just $14.99, you can have


2496
02:11:59,445 --> 02:12:01,213
up to six family members.


2497
02:12:01,213 --> 02:12:08,888
[Applause]


2498
02:12:08,888 --> 02:12:11,490
Everyone gets their own
account, their own library,


2499
02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:13,192
their own recommendations.


2500
02:12:13,192 --> 02:12:15,728
It's an incredible value.


2501
02:12:15,728 --> 02:12:17,396
And that is Apple Music.


2502
02:12:17,396 --> 02:12:18,063
Thank you.


2503
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:20,032
Turn it back to Tim.


2504
02:12:20,032 --> 02:12:22,334
[Cheers and applause]


2505
02:12:22,334 --> 02:12:24,970
>> TIM COOK:
Thanks, Eddy.


2506
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:26,806
Isn't that amazing?


2507
02:12:28,908 --> 02:12:32,645
We really love Apple Music,
and we hope that you do too.


2508
02:12:32,645 --> 02:12:34,146
And we are so excited about it,


2509
02:12:34,146 --> 02:12:37,216
and with all the countries
we are rolling out to,


2510
02:12:37,216 --> 02:12:40,753
we made a great ad to
tell the world about it.


2511
02:12:40,753 --> 02:12:43,222
And I'd love to run
it for you now.


2512
02:12:45,991 --> 02:12:48,894
>> This is Zane Lowe of
Beats 1.


2513
02:12:48,894 --> 02:12:50,996
We've got the whole world
locked in for this one.


2514
02:12:50,996 --> 02:12:52,264
Brand-new Pharrell.


2515
02:12:52,264 --> 02:13:01,340
[Music]


2516
02:13:44,817 --> 02:13:53,893
[Cheers and applause]


2517
02:13:55,294 --> 02:13:57,529
Now, music connects with us all
at such a deep, emotional level.


2518
02:13:57,529 --> 02:14:00,799
We couldn't be happier
to launch Apple Music,


2519
02:14:00,799 --> 02:14:02,801
and we can't wait till
you start listening to it


2520
02:14:02,801 --> 02:14:04,370
at the end of the month.


2521
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:06,972
This has been a jam-packed
morning.


2522
02:14:06,972 --> 02:14:10,276
I hope you've enjoyed
it as much as we have.


2523
02:14:10,276 --> 02:14:12,044
We want to thank
everybody for joining us,


2524
02:14:12,044 --> 02:14:17,349
especially the developers,
and I'd like to recognize all


2525
02:14:17,349 --> 02:14:21,654
of the people in Apple, all
of our team that have worked


2526
02:14:21,654 --> 02:14:24,957
so hard on making
and creating all


2527
02:14:24,957 --> 02:14:26,725
of these products

artists in music today,

02:14:57,923 --> 02:15:03,028
and it's not only a hot
new artist, but he's going

to do a worldwide premiere of
his newest song this morning.
