00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,918
easy as our products are to use.

178
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:39,358
Swift is extremely popular.

179
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,018
In fact, it's the fastest

180
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:43,158
growing programming language out

181
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:43,448
there.

182
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,278
Now Apple developers are already

183
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:47,998
using it in huge numbers.

184
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:53,298
In fact, over 350,000 apps have

185
00:07:53,298 --> 00:08:00,988
been written in Swift on the App

186
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:01,148
Store.

187
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,018
Now [applause] we believe that

188
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,018
Now [applause] we believe that

189
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:05,238
coding is an essential skill and

190
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:07,028
believe it should be offered by

191
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,788
every school in the world.

192
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:11,728
Learning to code has so many

193
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:12,428
benefits.

194
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,798
It develops problem solving and

195
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,188
critical thinking skills.

196
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:18,628
That's why created Everyone Can

197
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,598
Code with free teaching and

198
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,368
learning resources so that

199
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,068
everyone could learn to code.

200
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,338
It's been so successful and is

201
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:29,468
now available to tens of

202
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,228
millions of students around the

203
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:31,748
world.

204
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,797
Just imagine what this new

205
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,407
generation of coders will

206
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:36,888
create.

207
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,308
Whatever it is, I'm sure that

208
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:41,758
it's going to change the world.

209
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:45,068
At Apple, changing the world and

210
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,928
making it a better place is what

211
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:49,418
it's all about for us.

212
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,118
We aim to put the customer at

213
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:53,628
the center of everything that we

214
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:54,088
do.

215
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,518
That's why, together with you,

216
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:59,138
the developer community, we're

217
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,558
working hard to provide new and

218
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,558
working hard to provide new and

219
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,338
better experiences for our

220
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:06,918
customers to help them live a

221
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:07,408
better day.

222
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:10,278
And these experiences of course

223
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:12,008
are expressed through our four

224
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,748
amazing platforms.

225
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:17,758
Today is all about software, and

226
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,198
we've got some very exciting

227
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,158
updates across all four

228
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,048
platforms.

229
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,808
We're going to get started with

230
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:27,028
iOS.

231
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,948
IOS embodies our philosophy of

232
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,308
putting the customer at the

233
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,108
center of everything that we

234
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:32,798
design.

235
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,538
Every year, we deliver a major

236
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:39,478
iOS update that brings awesome

237
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,328
new features that will impact

238
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:43,258
the world.

239
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:45,458
To tell you all about what we

240
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,578
had planned for this year, I'd

241
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:48,968
like to introduce Craig

242
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:49,858
Frederique [phonetic].

243
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:49,988
Craig.

244
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:53,658
[ Applause ]

245
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:54,678
&gt;&gt; Hey, good morning.

246
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,668
[ Applause ]

247
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:58,578
All right.

248
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,878
The next release of iOS is, you

249
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,878
The next release of iOS is, you

250
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:07,098
guessed it, iOS 12.

251
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:10,428
Now, our customers, of course,

252
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:12,948
are going to receive iOS 12 as a

253
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,798
free software update.

254
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:17,308
Now, it's easy to forget now,

255
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,468
but iOS pioneered this approach

256
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,828
of helping you get more out of

257
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,488
the device you already own

258
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:23,838
through free updates.

259
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,128
And some of those updates have

260
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:26,478
been really quite profound.

261
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,128
Like the App Store, giving us a

262
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,128
whole new way to discover and

263
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:31,958
download apps.

264
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,878
It itself was delivered via

265
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,678
software update, as were the

266
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:37,558
folders we used to organize

267
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:38,208
those apps.

268
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,088
And can you imagine living

269
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:43,038
without Find My iPhone or

270
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:44,798
iMessage with its end-to-end

271
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:46,808
securely encrypted messaging.

272
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:49,208
Or the revolution in iPad

273
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,368
productivity with Slide Over,

274
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:54,598
Split View, and Drag and Drop,

275
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,818
or AR, changing the way we

276
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:58,438
interact with the world around

277
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,678
us, all delivered via software

278
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:01,188
updates.

279
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:02,528
And of course we want to get

280
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:02,528
And of course we want to get

281
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,318
these improvements to as many of

282
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:05,778
our customers as possible.

283
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,378
IOS 11 supports devices that

284
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,868
were introduced as far back as

285
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:13,688
2013, like the iPhone 5S.

286
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,578
And we just love the way

287
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:17,928
customers race to update to our

288
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,888
newest releases.

289
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:21,148
In fact, half of our customers

290
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:24,438
upgraded to iOS 11 in just seven

291
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:24,698
weeks.

292
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:25,988
It's incredible.

293
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:29,928
[ Applause ]

294
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:33,608
Now as we stand here today, 81

295
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,768
percent of our over a billion

296
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,718
active iOS devices are running

297
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:38,908
our latest release.

298
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:41,418
And now, when you look at the

299
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:44,268
competition, well it's hard to

300
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,578
say they really have a software

301
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:45,978
update model.

302
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,658
[ Applause ]

303
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:53,508
So iOS has the fastest adoption

304
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:54,918
of any operating system, but

305
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:57,138
what's much more important to us

306
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,268
is customer satisfaction, and

307
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:00,708
we're thrilled to report that

308
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,798
customer sat for iOS 11 is at 95

309
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,798
customer sat for iOS 11 is at 95

310
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:03,988
percent.

[ Applause ]

312
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,418
Now, delivering all of these

313
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,988
features across such a wide

314
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,518
range of devices will

315
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,398
maintaining high performance is

316
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:17,988
a challenge we take really

317
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,518
seriously, and so for iOS 12, we

318
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,558
are doubling down on

319
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:24,368
performance.

320
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:32,398
We're working top to bottom

321
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,408
making improvements, to make

322
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,918
your device faster and more

323
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,948
responsive, and because we want

324
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,398
these changes to be available to

325
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,338
the full range of our customers,

326
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:44,008
iOS 12 will be available on all

327
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:45,988
the same devices as iOS 11.

[ Applause ]

329
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,288
This is the largest base ever

330
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,798
supported by an Apple release,

331
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:56,538
and we're focusing our efforts

332
00:12:56,538 --> 00:12:59,048
especially on the oldest

333
00:12:59,048 --> 00:12:59,748
devices.

334
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,388
And while it's still early days,

335
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,388
And while it's still early days,

336
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:04,008
we're really pleased with some

337
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,158
of the results we're seeing.

338
00:13:05,348 --> 00:13:06,318
And so I'd like to share some

339
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:06,628
with you.

340
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,498
And I'm going to use an example

341
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:09,978
of a popular phone from a few

342
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:10,568
years ago.

343
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:12,478
This is the iPhone 6Plus.

344
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:15,098
Now on that device, iOS 12

345
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:15,978
delivers a number of

346
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,108
improvements across common

347
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:17,838
operations.

348
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,858
You'll see that apps launch up

349
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:21,318
to 40 percent faster.

350
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:23,148
The keyboard can come up up to

351
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,978
50 percent faster, and you can

352
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,218
slide to take a photo at up to

353
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:28,738
70 percent faster.

354
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:34,788
[ Applause ]

355
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:37,188
Now our deepest focus this year

356
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:39,318
is optimizing the system when

357
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,588
it's under load, and that's

358
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,558
where you need performance the

359
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,868
most and where iOS 12 really

360
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:44,448
shines.

361
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:46,838
Now, we've put iOS 12 through

362
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,948
our stress test, and we saw in

363
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,848
those conditions Share Sheet

364
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,098
coming up twice as fast and apps

365
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,448
launching twice as fast.

366
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,538
These are big, big improvements.

367
00:13:57,888 --> 00:13:59,508
Now this took changes-- thank

368
00:13:59,508 --> 00:13:59,998
you very much.

369
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,708
This took improvements in many,

370
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,708
This took improvements in many,

371
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,998
many places in the system, and I

372
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:05,168
want to highlight just one.

373
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:06,948
And it starts with the silicon.

374
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,358
You know, our tight

375
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,748
collaboration with our chip team

376
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:12,978
has enabled us to optimize iOS

377
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,918
across the full range of our A

378
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:16,308
series silicon.

379
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,098
Now CPUs traditionally respond

380
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,508
to increased demand for

381
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:22,868
performance by slowly ramping up

382
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:23,788
their clock speed.

383
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,088
Well now on IOS 12, we're much

384
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:26,778
smarter.

385
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,658
When we detect that you need a

386
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:29,828
burst of performance, like when

387
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,528
you begin scrolling or launching

388
00:14:31,658 --> 00:14:34,128
an app, we ramp up processor

389
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:35,708
performance instantly to its

390
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:37,978
highest states, delivering high

391
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,788
performance and to ramp it down

392
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:41,968
just as fast to preserve battery

393
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:42,868
life.

394
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,198
Now, these are just some of the

395
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:45,718
improvements that are coming to

396
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,968
not just our older devices, but

397
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,928
the full range of devices, and

398
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:52,718
that's a quick update on

399
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:52,988
performance.

400
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:58,718
[ Applause ]

401
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:01,048
Now if this is all we'd done in

402
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,478
iOS 12, I think it would be a

403
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,478
iOS 12, I think it would be a

404
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:04,118
great release, but we've done

405
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:04,898
more.

406
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:05,848
Much more.

407
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:07,308
And we have a lot to cover

408
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,208
today, and it starts with

409
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,328
augmented reality.

410
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:11,978
Yeah. [applause and cheering]

411
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:17,238
Now AR is transformational

412
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:18,108
technology.

413
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:20,368
By bringing experiences into the

414
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:23,138
real world, it enables all kinds

415
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,518
of new experiences, changing the

416
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,628
way we have fun and the way we

417
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:29,288
work, and in iOS 12, we wanted

418
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:30,698
to make an easy way to

419
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,108
experience AR across the system,

420
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,108
and to do that, we got together

421
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,668
with some of the greatest minds

422
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,058
in 3D at Pixar, and together we

423
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,438
created a new file format for

424
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:42,818
AR.

425
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:45,358
It's called USDZ, and it's a

426
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,418
compact, single-file format

427
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:49,638
that's optimized for sharing

428
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:51,498
while retaining great 3D

429
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,718
graphics and even animations.

430
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:57,048
Now, you can use USDZ across the

431
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,158
system from the files app, to

432
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,078
Safari, even sharing them over

433
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,938
messages and mail, and what's

434
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,938
messages and mail, and what's

435
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:04,548
great is you can place these 3D

436
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,568
objects into the real world.

437
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,868
It's something that's like AR

438
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:09,428
quick look.

439
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:10,868
It's really awesome.

440
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,828
Now, we want all kinds of

441
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:15,408
creatives to be able to create

442
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,548
content for AR, and so we're

443
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,598
working with the leading

444
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:21,378
companies for 3D tools and 3D

445
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:24,278
libraries to bring their support

446
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:24,818
for USDZ.

447
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,158
Now one company that's been all

448
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:31,438
in on USDZ and ARKit is Adobe,

449
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:32,768
and to tell you about what

450
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,008
they're up to, I'd like to

451
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:35,808
invite Abhay Parasnis, their

452
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:37,788
CTO, to the stage.

453
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:38,538
Abhay.

455
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:43,658
&gt;&gt; Thanks Craig.

456
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,608
It's great to be here this morn.

457
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:50,018
So at Adobe we believe augmented

458
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:51,948
reality is an incredibly

459
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:52,848
important technology.

460
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,768
And with ARKit, Apple is by far

461
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:58,598
the most powerful platform for

462
00:16:58,678 --> 00:16:58,988
AR.

463
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,828
So earlier Craig talked about

464
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:02,698
USDZ format.

465
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:02,698
USDZ format.

466
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:04,828
It's actually a pretty big deal.

467
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:07,927
There is now a way to deliver AR

468
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,368
experiences across the entire

469
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:11,238
iOS experience.

470
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:15,098
And so today we are actually

471
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:17,408
announcing that we are going to

472
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,677
bring native USDZ support to

473
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:20,988
Adobe's Creative Cloud.

474
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:24,927
[ Applause ]

475
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:28,138
With Creative Cloud, designers

476
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:30,098
and developers will now be able

477
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:32,698
to use familiar apps, apps that

478
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:33,898
they know and love, like

479
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:35,898
Photoshop or Dimension, to

480
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,448
create amazing AR content and

481
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,608
bring it easily via USDZ.

482
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:43,518
And of course, we are not going

483
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:44,308
to stop there.

484
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,368
We are going to bring the power

485
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:48,198
of immersive design to Creative

486
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:50,718
Cloud with a new set of services

487
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,738
and applications including a

488
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,018
brand-new iOS application that's

489
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,328
going to let all of you design

490
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,238
amazing AR experiences quickly.

491
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:02,538
So, you will be able to bring in

492
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:02,538
So, you will be able to bring in

493
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:06,088
images, videos, text, any object

494
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,588
from Creative Cloud directly

495
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,248
into a native AR environment.

496
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:13,738
In fact, for the first time with

497
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:16,138
Creative Cloud and iOS, you will

498
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,418
have a what you see is what you

499
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:20,918
get editing in AR.

500
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:21,888
It's pretty cool.

501
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:27,548
So, come join this afternoon

00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:28,778
State of the Union where we're

503
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:30,258
able to give you a sneak peak of

504
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:31,678
some of these new immersive

505
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,358
design tools for the first time.

506
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:35,048

[applause] Now a critical part

510
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,828
of enabling AR is accurate

511
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:46,768
measurement, and fortunately the

512
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,868
precise calibration of sensors

513
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,058
in iOS devices and our tight

514
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:52,758
hardware software integration

515
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:54,468
mean that we do this really

516
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,068
well, and we want to enable

517
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,788
everyone to take advantage of

518
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:58,758
this capability.

00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:01,328
So we're introducing a new app,

520
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,388
and it's called Measure.

521
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,388
and it's called Measure.

522
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,528
It makes it really easy to

523
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,238
measure objects, detect

524
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:08,418
rectangles and get their

525
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,088
dimensions, and measure lines

526
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:11,908
along surfaces, and I'd like to

527
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:12,868
show it to you now.

528
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:17,188
[applause] Now, in looking for

529
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,368
something to measure, I ended up

530
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,198
digging through the attic and

531
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:26,948
came upon my old suitcase from

532
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,308
my traveling days in college.

533
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,888
A lot of memories in here.

534
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,418
Now I'm actually in the Measure

535
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,528
app, and you see I can easily

536
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:39,448
measure along this suitcase by

537
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:43,748
just tapping and dragging out a

538
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,178
line, like that, and check that

539
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:46,878
out.

540
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:47,688
It's a measurement.

541
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:52,068
[applause] Now, what's really

542
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,888
cool is I can extend these

543
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:56,498
measurements so I can just tap,

544
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,178
drag along another edge just

545
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:01,968
like that, and even take it into

546
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,658
full 3D by dragging down to the

547
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,658
full 3D by dragging down to the

548
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:07,268
bottom like that.

549
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:07,908
Isn't that cool?

550
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:12,908
[ Applause ]

551
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:14,288
Now I mentioned that we could

552
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,328
automatically detect rectangles

553
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:17,688
and show you dimensions of

554
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:18,118
objects.

555
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,318
So I have a photo here actually.

556
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:21,698
It's one my mom always wanted me

557
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:24,178
to travel with of me as a baby,

558
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,148
and so, you see, what I can do

559
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,778
with Measure is it automatically

560
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:31,068
detects the dimensions of that

561
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:31,898
photo.

562
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,028
I can just tap and get, oh,

563
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,388
yeah, a cute little baby, wasn't

564
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:36,455
I?

565
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:37,538
And you can get measurements

566
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:38,278
just like that.

567
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:38,988
It's really fantastic.

568
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:43,038
[ Applause ]

569
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,048
Now, I'd like to turn now to

570
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:48,388
USDZ and its support throughout

571
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:48,918
the system.

572
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:50,878
You know, you can experience

573
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,468
USDZ in so many places, and one

574
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:53,778
of those places is news.

575
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:55,448
Now here's an article.

576
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:56,508
We're all accustomed to seeing

577
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:57,738
images in news articles.

578
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,298
But check this out.

579
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:01,488
Here you see a USDZ asset.

580
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:02,688
It can just tap on this little

581
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:02,688
It can just tap on this little

582
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:05,518
3D control and jump right in and

583
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:06,278
experience it.

584
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:07,158
You can see the amazing

585
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:08,658
animations that are possible,

586
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:09,868
and of course it's fully

587
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,568
interactive.

588
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:14,308
So I can zoom in and pan.

589
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,068
Isn't that amazing?

590
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:22,558
[applause] Now USDZ is also

591
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:23,378
great in the web.

592
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,148
So here I am at the Fender

593
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:26,448
website and actually let you

594
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:27,828
configure your guitar with the

595
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,158
kind of finish and pickguard

596
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:29,738
that you want.

597
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,638
So I can select a configuration

598
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,408
option here, and then I can see

599
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,868
the guitar I've configured.

600
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,318
So I'm just going to tap in.

601
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:38,198
Of course I can see the guitar

602
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:39,858
here, but wouldn't it be cool if

603
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,438
I could see it in the real world

604
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,698
in its real size?

605
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:44,408
Well, there it is.

606
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:44,648
Check that out.

607
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:45,118
[applause] I think I'm going to

608
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:52,318
capture that for posterity.

609
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,738
And that's a quick look at USDZ

610
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:58,818
and Measure in iOS 12.

611
00:21:59,438 --> 00:22:01,038
Next-- thank you.

612
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:04,598
[applause] Next, I'd like to

613
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,828
talk about the key technology

614
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:08,608
behind these augmented reality

615
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:11,248
experiences, and that's ARKit.

616
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,118
ARKit opens up the world of AR

617
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:15,068
to hundreds of millions of

618
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:17,038
users, making it the world's

619
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,768
largest AR platform by far.

620
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:22,668
And we're on a relentless pace

621
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:24,658
of advancement with AR, and that

622
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:28,508
continues today with ARKit 2.

623
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:33,528
Yes. ARKit 2 delivers advances

624
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,398
with improved face tracking,

625
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:37,498
more realistic rendering, and

626
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:39,918
support for 3D object detection

627
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:41,968
and persistence, which enables

628
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:44,088
launching into AR experiences

629
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,468
associated with a particular

630
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:48,128
object or a physical space, like

631
00:22:48,128 --> 00:22:49,498
starting a game built around a

632
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,308
physical toy or having a

633
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,788
physical classroom serve as the

634
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,538
foundation for a lesson that was

635
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:56,068
authored in AR.

636
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,578
But probably best is the support

637
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,668
for shared experiences.

638
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:02,768
Now this delivers true,

639
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:02,768
Now this delivers true,

640
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:05,008
multiuser augmented reality.

641
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:06,998
You and the people around you

642
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:08,428
will be able to see your own

643
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:10,408
perspective on a common virtual

644
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:10,928
environment.

645
00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:12,538
And to help all you developers

646
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,698
get started, we created this

647
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,518
sample app written in Swift that

648
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:18,118
you'll all be getting today.

649
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:20,388
Now, check out how both players

650
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:22,438
and even a third observer can

651
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:23,688
all experience the same

652
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:24,918
environment in real time.

653
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:25,808
It's really fun.

654
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:30,798
[ Applause ]

655
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:33,468
Now, we've also brought in a

656
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,278
select few developers into our

657
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,438
labs over the last couple of

658
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:38,748
weeks to work with ARKit, and

659
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:39,608
they love it.

660
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:41,578
Now, one of them is Lego.

661
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:44,118
And what they've done is so fun,

662
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,208
you just need to see it.

663
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:48,228
So I'm pleased to invite Martin

664
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:50,328
Sanders, director of innovation

665
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,728
of Lego, to the stage to give

666
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:53,238
you a live demonstration.

667
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:53,688
Martin.

668
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:54,788
&gt;&gt; Craig, thank you very much.

669
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:58,628
[ Applause ]

670
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:00,888
Creating and playing with

671
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,228
physical Lego sets brings great

672
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,228
physical Lego sets brings great

673
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:05,288
joy to millions of children and

674
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:07,448
Lego fans all over the world.

675
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,228
And now, with ARKit 2, we get to

676
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:12,408
expand those creative

677
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:14,348
possibilities like never before

678
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:16,868
and take things beyond the

679
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:17,398
physical.

680
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:20,958
What we try to do is combine

681
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:22,858
physical and digital together to

682
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,148
really open up those creative

683
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:26,028
play possibilities, because our

684
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:27,688
Lego sets are really the start

685
00:24:27,688 --> 00:24:28,758
point for all of those

686
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,038
children's imaginations.

687
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:31,448
And when we get a chance to

688
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:34,958
really imbed ARKit 2, it takes

689
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:35,818
it to the next level.

690
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:37,178
Let me show you what I mean.

691
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:40,868
Here we have Assembly Square.

692
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:42,348
It's one of our Lego creator

693
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,508
sets and already has so many

694
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:46,048
great details it's awesome to

695
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:46,398
play with.

696
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:47,858
But wouldn't it be great if we

697
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:49,338
could take things even further?

698
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,928
Well now with 3D object

699
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:54,038
detection, we get to recognize

700
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:55,848
our models and bring them to

701
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:55,988
life.

702
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:03,608
[ Music ]

703
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:03,608
[ Music ]

704
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:05,688
And just look at all of those

705
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:07,238
rich details we can now bring

706
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:10,098
into our sets, because when we

707
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:11,898
combine physical and digital

708
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:14,238
together like this, it really

709
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:15,628
opens up those creative play

710
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:16,338
possibilities.

711
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,988
And there's so much to do here.

712
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:21,618
Did you see these icons of the

713
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:22,758
people and objects?

714
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:24,908
Well they represent missions and

715
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:26,208
stories that we can explore.

716
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,398
And with a world as rich and as

717
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:30,878
immersive as this, who wouldn't

718
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:31,458
want to play?

719
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:32,938
So let's add a character.

720
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:35,228
How about this little guy here?

721
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,058
&gt;&gt; Welcome back, let's go on an

722
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:38,328
adventure.

723
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:38,648
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

724
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:39,708
Let's go on an adventure.

725
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,858
But going on an adventure with

726
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:44,468
friends is often way more fun.

727
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:46,228
Anders, why don't you pop in

728
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:46,518
here.

729
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:47,838
&gt;&gt; I'm always up for an

730
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,118
adventure.

731
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:50,628
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

732
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:53,618
Because now with ARKit 2's

733
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,718
multiuser support, we get to

734
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:58,098
play with up to four friends in

735
00:25:58,168 --> 00:26:00,028
the same space.

736
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:00,928
Let's go ahead and add a few

737
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:01,828
things from our collection,

738
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:02,138
Anders.

739
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:02,138
Anders.

740
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,188
&gt;&gt; Okay. I will add a bank over

741
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:05,368
here.

742
00:26:06,258 --> 00:26:07,498
&gt;&gt; Very nice, I like it.

743
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:10,728
How about taking this for a

744
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:15,268
spin.

745
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:17,188
Let's just look at all those

746
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:18,618
rich details you can see on the

747
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,578
outside of the building and even

748
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:25,548
on the inside.

749
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:27,388
Yeah, I think I'm going to add

750
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:27,868
this guy.

751
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,268
He's definitely going to keep

752
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:29,968
the bank safe.

753
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:34,488
Oh look, my character's hungry.

754
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:35,938
Let's take him over to the

755
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:36,438
bakery.

756
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,128
Well let's see what they have.

757
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:41,098
Because now with ARKit 2, we get

758
00:26:41,218 --> 00:26:42,758
to see inside our physical

759
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,038
creations and check out all the

760
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:46,218
details that were hidden before.

761
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:48,608
We've got a ballerina, a little

762
00:26:48,818 --> 00:26:51,348
music session going on, and

763
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:52,648
let's make a bathroom-- oops

764
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,098
sorry.

765
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:54,628
Moving on.

766
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:56,138
Oh, another play trigger in the

767
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:56,588
bakery.

768
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:58,158
Let's see what happens when I

769
00:26:58,198 --> 00:26:58,738
click on this.

770
00:26:58,738 --> 00:26:59,508
&gt;&gt; Um, fresh [inaudible].

771
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:02,348
&gt;&gt; Oh, that doesn't look too

772
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:02,348
&gt;&gt; Oh, that doesn't look too

773
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:02,438
good.

774
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:03,188
&gt;&gt; Anders, I've got a situation.

775
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:06,248
I'm going to need your help over

776
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:06,728
here.

777
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:07,458
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, okay.

778
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,698
I've got a firetruck.

779
00:27:08,698 --> 00:27:08,888
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

780
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,038
You put out those flames while--

781
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,258
oh, oh dear.

782
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:13,678
Somebody's got themselves

783
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:15,798
trapped on the roof, so I'm

784
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:17,338
going to use this helicopter to

785
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:20,298
go and pick up these clowns.

786
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:23,528
[music] How are you getting on

787
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:25,198
down there Anders?

788
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:27,498
&gt;&gt; I'm almost done, almost done.

789
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:29,588
&gt;&gt; Great. Those guys are safe.

790
00:27:29,978 --> 00:27:32,468
And the flames look like they're

791
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:33,218
almost out.

792
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:36,938
Perfect, we did it.

793
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:39,258
Yeah. What?

794
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:43,948
[ Applause ]

795
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:46,328
And we've even unlocked a new

796
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:47,288
item for our collection.

797
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:49,658
But the fun doesn't need to end

798
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:52,238
there because with ARKit 2, we

799
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,178
get to save our entire world

800
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:58,148
back into our physical set and

801
00:27:58,148 --> 00:27:59,338
pick up where we left off.

802
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:02,868
[applause] All right.

803
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:02,868
[applause] All right.

804
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:03,718
That's awesome.

805
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:05,908
So much fun.

806
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:07,298
But what makes this truly

807
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:08,868
amazing is how with just a

808
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:11,178
single Lego creation and ARKit 2

809
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:12,558
it really opens up those

810
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,058
creative play possibilities.

811
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:16,478
So look out for more Lego AR

812
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:18,028
experiences in the App Store

813
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,188
later this year.

814
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:19,988
Thank you very much everybody.

815
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:23,718
[ Applause ]

816
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:25,948
&gt;&gt; Isn't that great?

817
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:27,928
So that's our update on AR and

818
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:28,598
iOS 12.

819
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:30,738
Next, I'd like to turn to

820
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:31,478
Photos.

821
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:34,568
You know, over a trillion photos

822
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,668
are captured on iPhone each

823
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:40,528
year, and Photos is the best way

824
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:43,108
to relive and share those

825
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:43,718
moments.

826
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:46,008
This year we're making photos

827
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,928
even better, and it starts with

828
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:48,578
Search.

829
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:51,138
Search has powerful object and

830
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:52,178
scene recognition.

831
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:53,778
It lets you search for photos

832
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:55,118
based on things like searching

833
00:28:55,118 --> 00:28:57,728
for cars or dogs or flowers, and

834
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,848
that's a great way to explore

835
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:01,268
your library, but in iOS 12,

836
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,468
Search now starts working for

837
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,468
Search now starts working for

838
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:06,228
you even before you start typing

839
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:07,728
with Search suggestions.

840
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:09,488
It'll highlight things for you

841
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,888
like key moments and people that

842
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:14,058
are important to you, places

843
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:15,128
where you've taken some great

844
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:16,528
photos and even categories of

845
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:18,798
photos like hiking and water

846
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,358
sports.

847
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:21,518
And Search is much more powerful

848
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:21,998
than ever.

849
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:23,698
You can search for places by

850
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:24,468
business name.

851
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:25,738
So you could search for SFMOMA

852
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:28,198
or even a broad category like

853
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:28,868
museum.

854
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:32,528
And, Photos indexes over four

855
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:34,288
million events by time and

856
00:29:34,348 --> 00:29:34,688
place.

857
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,548
Things like sporting events and

858
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:38,078
concerts, and so you can search

859
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,768
for them and find photos you

860
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,058
took at those events.

861
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:43,098
And search is super powerful.

862
00:29:43,268 --> 00:29:44,368
You can now search for multiple

863
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,518
search terms like surfing and

864
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,868
vacation and even get

865
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,748
suggestions for additional

866
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,138
search terms to help you find

867
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:52,488
exactly what you're looking for.

868
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,828
And now in iOS 12 we have an all

869
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:55,448
new tab.

870
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:57,758
It's called For You.

871
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:00,198
And with For You, you have all

872
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,428
of your memories, so those great

873
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:03,488
memory movies, but more like

874
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:03,488
memory movies, but more like

875
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,408
featured photos highlighting a

876
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,648
photo that you took on this day

877
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:08,768
in past years.

878
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:11,528
And Effects Suggestions, for

879
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:13,118
instance, suggesting looping a

880
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:16,028
live photo or applying a new

881
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:17,658
portrait effect to one of your

882
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:18,678
portrait photos.

883
00:30:18,998 --> 00:30:20,298
And we even highlight your

884
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:22,328
shared album activity.

885
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:24,028
Now when it comes to sharing,

886
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:25,268
there are many ways you can

887
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:27,578
share photos, but our focus is

888
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,518
on sharing great photos with the

889
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:31,628
people you care about most, and

890
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,368
that's why this year in For You

891
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:35,348
we've added Sharing Suggestions.

892
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:37,628
So imagine you've gone out for a

893
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:38,858
great dinner with some friends

894
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:39,958
and you took some photos.

895
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:42,038
Well afterwards in For You,

896
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,368
you'll see a suggestion like

897
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:44,888
this to share those photos.

898
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,908
If you tap in, you'll see that

899
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,358
photos is even recommending a

900
00:30:49,508 --> 00:30:52,108
set of photos from that set that

901
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:53,918
you might want to share and

902
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,678
suggest who you might want to

903
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:57,668
share them with based in part by

904
00:30:57,668 --> 00:30:59,018
the people that appeared in the

905
00:30:59,018 --> 00:30:59,558
photos.

906
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,148
And when you share them, they're

907
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:03,278
shared at full resolution out of

908
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:03,278
shared at full resolution out of

909
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,228
your iCloud photo library and

910
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:07,558
when you're friend receives

911
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,278
them, something really magical

912
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:09,708
happens.

913
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:11,338
Their phone searches their

914
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,838
libraries for other photos they

915
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,548
took at that event and suggest

916
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:15,898
that they share them back to

917
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:17,748
you, so you both can end up with

918
00:31:17,748 --> 00:31:17,988
a full set.

919
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:24,558
[ Applause ]

920
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:26,118
Now this is built around

921
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,448
iMessage so of course it's

922
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,868
private, using end-to-end

923
00:31:28,868 --> 00:31:30,798
encryption, and all of those

924
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:32,718
smarts are done with on-device

925
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:33,638
machine learning.

926
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:35,798
So that's your quick update on

927
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:38,318
Photos in iOS 12, and next,

928
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:40,868
let's turn to Siri.

929
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:42,948
Now Siri is by far the world's

930
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:45,228
most used digital assistant with

931
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:47,178
over 10 billion requests

932
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:49,128
processed per month, and because

933
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:50,808
Siri works across all your

934
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,848
devices, it's always there to

935
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:53,978
help you through your day

936
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,328
getting things done.

937
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:57,908
Now we all know that Siri works

938
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:00,298
with many third-party apps for

939
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:02,378
things like messaging, ride

940
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:02,378
things like messaging, ride

941
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,128
sharing, and payments.

942
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:05,978
But we wanted to make Siri able

943
00:32:05,978 --> 00:32:07,968
to do much more for you, and

944
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,528
we're doing that by taking

945
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,238
advantage of the power of apps

946
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:13,118
with a new feature we call

947
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:13,998
Shortcuts.

948
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:16,598
Now with shortcuts any app can

949
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:19,028
expose quick actions to Siri.

950
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:20,748
Let's look at some examples.

951
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:22,758
Now say you have the Tile app

952
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:24,128
because you're always losing

953
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:24,868
your keys.

954
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:27,028
Well, the Tile app can expose

955
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,458
the option to add a shortcut to

956
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,168
Siri.

957
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:32,138
And you can assign your own

958
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:34,148
phrase, such as I lost my keys

959
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:35,608
would be a good choice, and when

960
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:38,038
you then say it, Siri will

961
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:40,858
automatically activate Tile and

962
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,278
show you right in the Siri UI

963
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:44,098
start ringing your Tile just

964
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:44,668
like that.

965
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:45,688
It's really great.

966
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:46,028
[applause]

967
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:49,638
[ Applause ]

968
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:51,688
Of course there's so many uses

969
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:52,618
for this kind of thing.

970
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:54,298
You could say game time to get

971
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:55,558
your team's schedule from

972
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,188
TeamSnap or help me relax to

973
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,508
kick off a meditation or order

974
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:02,778
my groceries to order your

975
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:02,778
my groceries to order your

976
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:03,338
usual.

977
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,888
You know, with millions of apps,

978
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,558
Shortcut enables incredible

979
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:09,108
possibilities for how you use

980
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:09,668
Siri.

981
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:12,768
Now, as you know, Siri is more

982
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:13,538
than just a voice.

983
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:14,948
Siri is working all the time in

984
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:16,298
the background to make proactive

985
00:33:16,388 --> 00:33:18,288
suggestions for you even before

986
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,788
you ask, and now with Shortcut,

987
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,668
Siri can do so much more.

988
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:25,418
So, for instance, let's say you

989
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:26,938
order a coffee every morning at

990
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:28,688
Phil's before you go to work.

991
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:30,868
Well now, Siri can suggest right

992
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,348
on your lock screen that you do

993
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:32,608
that.

994
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,678
You tap on it, and you can place

995
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:36,758
the order right from there.

996
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,558
Or if when you get to the gym

997
00:33:38,758 --> 00:33:40,068
you use Active to track

998
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:42,158
workouts, well that suggestion

999
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:43,698
will appear right on your lock

1000
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:44,078
screen.

1001
00:33:44,518 --> 00:33:45,448
And this even works when you

1002
00:33:45,448 --> 00:33:46,608
pull down into Search.

1003
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:48,328
You'll get great suggestions.

1004
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:49,888
Like say you're running late for

1005
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,318
a meeting, well Siri will

1006
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:52,968
suggest you text the meeting

1007
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:53,548
organizer.

1008
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:56,038
Or when you go to the movie,

1009
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:57,628
suggest that you turn on Do Not

1010
00:33:57,628 --> 00:33:58,448
Disturb.

1011
00:33:58,448 --> 00:33:59,598
That's just being considerate.

1012
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:03,108
And remind you to call grandma

1013
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:03,108
And remind you to call grandma

1014
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:03,668
on her birthday.

1015
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,368
Just tap, and it'll dial the

1016
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:06,108
call for you.

1017
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:08,288
Now, we think we're all going to

1018
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:10,218
really enjoy using Shortcuts,

1019
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,278
and so we went a step further.

1020
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:13,628
We wanted to let you create your

1021
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:17,238
own shortcuts as users, multiple

1022
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:18,618
steps across multiple

1023
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:20,767
applications, and we're doing it

1024
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,968
with a new Shortcuts app.

1025
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:25,718
So with the Shortcuts app, you

1026
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:27,858
could do something like create a

1027
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,028
shortcut for surf time, and it

1028
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,088
could go get you the surf

1029
00:34:31,158 --> 00:34:32,948
report, look up the current

1030
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,097
weather, get you the ETA to the

1031
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:36,428
beach, and even create a

1032
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:37,747
reminder for you to put on

1033
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:39,508
sunscreen when you get there.

1034
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:42,517
Now, it's all done with simple

1035
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:45,037
drag and drop steps in the

1036
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:47,428
Shortcuts editor right here.

1037
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:49,118
It's really easy.

1038
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:50,478
Now to show you how Shortcuts

1039
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:52,088
can streamline your day, I'd

1040
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:52,898
like to invite one of our

1041
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:54,948
leaders from our Siri Shortcuts

1042
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:57,097
project, Kim Beverette

1043
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,138
[phonetic], to the stage to give

1044
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,008
you a live demo.

1045
00:34:59,228 --> 00:34:59,578
Kim.

1046
00:34:59,578 --> 00:34:59,788
&gt;&gt; Hey!

1047
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:07,108
[ Applause ]

1048
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:07,108
[ Applause ]

1049
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,508
I'm am so stoked to show you

1050
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:10,308
Siri Shortcuts.

1051
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:11,748
To do that, I'm going to walk

1052
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:12,908
you through my day.

1053
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:14,018
So imagine it's the morning.

1054
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:15,398
I'm headed to work, and I pick

1055
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:17,608
up my phone, and I see this

1056
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,228
suggestion from Phil's Coffee.

1057
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,158
Siri has learned that I do this

1058
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:22,728
most mornings, so now I can just

1059
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:24,958
tap on the suggestion and I see

1060
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,108
all the details I need to

1061
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:28,078
confirm my perfect Mint Monkey

1062
00:35:28,078 --> 00:35:29,328
Dough right here on the lock

1063
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:30,638
screen without even going into

1064
00:35:30,638 --> 00:35:31,028
the app.

1065
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:33,018
So let's get caffeinated.

1066
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:34,868
And I'm done.

1067
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:38,668
Fast forward a little bit, and

1068
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:39,958
I'm sitting at my desk at my

1069
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,248
office and I need to know when

1070
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:42,518
my next meeting is.

1071
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:43,738
I'll go to the Up Next widget,

1072
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:45,648
and it looks like I am running a

1073
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:46,868
little late for a rather

1074
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:48,808
important meeting, so I should

1075
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:50,058
probably let someone know.

1076
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:51,868
And it looks like Shortcuts is a

1077
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:52,788
few steps ahead of me.

1078
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,198
I could call into the meeting,

1079
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:55,668
or I could let the organizer

1080
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:56,628
know that I am running late.

1081
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:58,228
I should probably tell Arie

1082
00:35:58,228 --> 00:35:58,788
what's up.

1083
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:00,548
That looks like just what I want

1084
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,918
to say, sorry Arie, let's send

1085
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,918
to say, sorry Arie, let's send

1086
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:03,838
it.

1087
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:07,948
Perfect. I also want to show you

1088
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,628
how you can add a shortcut to

1089
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:10,178
Siri.

1090
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:11,738
So let's take a look at Kayak.

1091
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:14,778
I keep all of my travel details

1092
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:15,398
in Kayak.

1093
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:17,258
Most important is my post WWDC

1094
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,658
relaxation trip to Los Angeles.

1095
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:21,778
You can see I have got my

1096
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,778
flight, my hotel, all the

1097
00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:25,348
details, everything I need, but

1098
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:26,818
what I really want is to be able

1099
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,108
to use this and get to this

1100
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:29,898
information with my voice while

1101
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,158
I'm on the go.

1102
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,268
So, let's head back, and I can

1103
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:36,038
just tap add to Siri, record my

1104
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:38,958
custom phrase, travel plans

1105
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:42,578
[beep], and I'm done.

1106
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,808
So now when I land at the

1107
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:46,478
airport and I'm about to get in

1108
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:48,008
a cab and I could really use

1109
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,748
that hotel address, I can just

1110
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:54,198
say, travel plans.

1111
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:56,368
&gt;&gt; Kayak says your hotel is at

1112
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:58,188
929 South Broadway.

1113
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:00,248
You can check in after 3 p.m.

1114
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:01,668
&gt;&gt; Isn't that cool?

1115
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:02,238
[applause] It's pretty cool.

1116
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:02,238
[applause] It's pretty cool.

1117
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:08,558
[ Applause ]

1118
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:10,158
So I would love to be on that

1119
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:11,478
vacation, but I should, I don't

1120
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:12,978
know, probably finish this demo,

1121
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,088
so let's head back to work, and

1122
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:16,308
I can show you how the Shortcut

1123
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:17,728
app can help me with my commute

1124
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:18,568
home.

1125
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,878
We start in the Gallery where

1126
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,118
there's hundreds of premade

1127
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,578
shortcuts that you can download,

1128
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:25,958
or we can hop over to the

1129
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,478
library, and I've got a bunch of

1130
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,548
shortcuts here, but I want to

1131
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:29,768
show you my heading home

1132
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:30,148
shortcut.

1133
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,258
You can see that it's just

1134
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:34,238
really a series of steps.

1135
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:36,568
It grabs my location and travel

1136
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,598
time, and it sends my ETA to my

1137
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:39,248
roommate.

1138
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:41,458
It sets my HomeKit thermostat to

1139
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:43,038
70 degrees, and it turns on my

1140
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:43,478
fan.

1141
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:45,348
And last, it gets directions

1142
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:46,638
home with Apple maps with the

1143
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:47,928
best route to avoid traffic.

1144
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:50,398
Now this is already pretty cool,

1145
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,668
but I happen to be an NPR News

1146
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,438
junkie, so I should probably

1147
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,708
just add that to my shortcut to

1148
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:57,058
save me some trouble on the ride

1149
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:57,298
home.

1150
00:37:57,638 --> 00:38:00,158
Let's tap search, and there's a

1151
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:01,698
bunch I can add here, but I can

1152
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,138
just tap Siri suggestions, and

1153
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,138
just tap Siri suggestions, and

1154
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:06,048
there it is, play KQED Radio,

1155
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:09,168
we'll drag this in, drop it, and

1156
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:09,678
we're set.

1157
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,388
I've already added the shortcut

1158
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:14,168
to Siri with a custom phrase,

1159
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:16,448
heading home, so now, whenever I

1160
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:17,958
leave work, I can just say,

1161
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:21,628
heading home.

1162
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:24,528
&gt;&gt; You will get there in one

1163
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:24,808
hour.

1164
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:26,698
I sent a message to Cheryl.

1165
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:28,838
Your thermostat is set to 70

1166
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:30,168
degrees, and I turned on the

1167
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:30,758
fan.

1168
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:34,248
Playing KQED Radio [music].

1169
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:35,988
&gt;&gt; Right?

That's Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12.

1172
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:43,728
Thank you so much.

1173
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,018

1175
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:54,698
&gt;&gt; And that's Siri Shortcuts.

1176
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:57,818
It works on iPhone and iPad, and

1177
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:58,838
of course you can run your

1178
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,178
shortcuts from your home pod and

1179
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:02,148
your Apple Watch.

1180
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:02,148
your Apple Watch.

1181
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:03,998
And that's your quick update on

1182
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:04,908
Siri.

1183
00:39:05,488 --> 00:39:08,708
Next, let's talk about apps, and

1184
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,178
to tell you about the latest,

1185
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:11,578
I'm going to hand it off to

1186
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:12,168

00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:20,918
&gt;&gt; Hello. Thanks Craig and it is

1190
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:22,488
so great to be here.

1191
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:24,128
I'm excited to tell you about

1192
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,848
some great updates in some of

1193
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:28,018
our most popular apps, starting

1194
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:30,138
with one of my favorites, News.

1195
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:33,698
So News is a personalized feed

1196
00:39:34,078 --> 00:39:35,158
where you can see all the

1197
00:39:35,158 --> 00:39:36,828
stories you want to read pulled

1198
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:39,078
together from trusted sources.

1199
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,968
And, our top stories are

1200
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:43,778
handpicked by the Apple News

1201
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:47,808
editorial team to make a great

1202
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:49,688
collection of curated content.

1203
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:53,878
With our new browse tab, you can

1204
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:55,458
discover new channels and

1205
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:57,828
topics, and we've made it even

1206
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,618
easier to jump to your favorites

1207
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:01,378
because that's why they're your

1208
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:03,148
favorites, right?

1209
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:03,148
favorites, right?

1210
00:40:03,508 --> 00:40:07,308
News shines on the iPad.

1211
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,218
We've added a new sidebar, and

1212
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:11,468
it's a great way to navigate.

1213
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:14,858
It makes it easy and I fun to

1214
00:40:14,858 --> 00:40:16,548
dig into the areas you're most

1215
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:17,538
interested in.

1216
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,948
So that's news.

1217
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:22,308
Now, we've completely rebuilt

1218
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:24,368
the Stocks app, and it's got a

1219
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:25,718
beautiful new design.

1220
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:28,228
Of course, you can still see the

1221
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:29,968
stock prices and the changes at

1222
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:31,838
a glance, but we've added spark

1223
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,608
lines, those little charts, that

1224
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:35,908
show the stock performance

1225
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:37,358
throughout the day.

1226
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:40,248
And that's cool, but are you

1227
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:40,968
ready?

1228
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,828
We are so excited to announce

1229
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:46,408
we're bringing Apple News to

1230
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:46,988
Stocks.

1231
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,568
[ Applause ]

1232
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,278
I'm really excited about that,

1233
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:54,988
and the top stories in Stocks

1234
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,898
features business news, right,

1235
00:40:58,068 --> 00:40:59,398
curated by the Apple News

1236
00:40:59,398 --> 00:40:59,918
editors.

1237
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,188
It's pretty terrific.

1238
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:03,258
You can tap on any stock to get

1239
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:03,258
You can tap on any stock to get

1240
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:04,578
a more detailed view, so you can

1241
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:06,338
see an interactive chart that

1242
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,298
now includes after hours

1243
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:11,118
pricing, and you see relevant

1244
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:12,508
headlines from Apple News

1245
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:15,188
curated by our Apple News

1246
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:15,578
editor.

1247
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:16,378
So it looks great.

1248
00:41:16,378 --> 00:41:17,738
And if you tap on one of those

1249
00:41:17,798 --> 00:41:19,828
headlines, you'll see the full

1250
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:22,818
article without leaving the app,

1251
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:25,198
and of course it's formatted to

1252
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:28,478
look gorgeous on the iPhone.

1253
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:31,608
Now, with iOS 12, we're bringing

1254
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:33,948
Stocks to iPad.

1255
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:37,788
[ Applause ]

1256
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,498
It's pretty great, and we take

1257
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,608
advantage of the larger display,

1258
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:42,968
so you can keep your eye on your

1259
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:44,978
stocks on the left while you

1260
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:46,388
browse through your financial

1261
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:46,648
news.

1262
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,358
It's a pretty great experience.

1263
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,968
Next up, Voice Memos.

1264
00:41:51,368 --> 00:41:52,958
We've also completely rebuilt

1265
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:55,338
Voice Memos to make it even

1266
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:59,118
easier to use, and we're

1267
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:00,858
bringing Voice Memos to the iPad

1268
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:01,778
for the first time.

1269
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:06,218
[ Applause ]

1270
00:42:06,718 --> 00:42:08,228
Importantly, we've also added

1271
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:10,038
iCloud support so your

1272
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:11,348
recordings stay in sync across

1273
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:12,188
all your devices.

1274
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,228
We think iPad users are just

1275
00:42:14,228 --> 00:42:16,258
going to love this.

1276
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:19,698
And we think that iBooks is the

1277
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:21,268
best way to discover and

1278
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:23,518
experience eBooks as well as

1279
00:42:23,518 --> 00:42:25,958
audio books, and with iOS 12,

1280
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:28,328
we're introducing an all new

1281
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:31,188
design, and we think the update

1282
00:42:31,188 --> 00:42:33,508
is so great, we're calling it

1283
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:36,058
Apple Books, a new name.

1284
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:37,288
Very dramatic.

1285
00:42:38,908 --> 00:42:39,728
We dropped the i.

1286
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:43,688
[applause] Apple Books has some

1287
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:44,678
great new features.

1288
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,228
For example, Reading Now, with a

1289
00:42:47,258 --> 00:42:48,238
preview that makes it really

1290
00:42:48,238 --> 00:42:49,668
easy for you to pick reading

1291
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:50,888
right where you left off.

1292
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:53,208
And there's so much more,

1293
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:55,748
including a stunning new store

1294
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:57,918
that makes browsing through your

1295
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:00,188
eBooks and audio books better

1296
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:00,748
than ever.

1297
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:04,288
We love these updates, and we

1298
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:04,288
We love these updates, and we

1299
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:07,108
think you will too, but we also

1300
00:43:07,238 --> 00:43:10,938
have a smart and safe way to use

1301
00:43:10,938 --> 00:43:11,858
your apps in the car.

1302
00:43:11,998 --> 00:43:13,878
I think you know I'm talking

1303
00:43:13,878 --> 00:43:15,008
about Car Play.

1304
00:43:15,738 --> 00:43:16,988
Car Play already supports

1305
00:43:17,048 --> 00:43:18,688
third-party audio and voice

1306
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,378
messaging, you know, voice

1307
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:22,838
calling and messaging apps, you

1308
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:23,458
problem know that.

1309
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:25,558
But what you might not know is

1310
00:43:25,558 --> 00:43:28,238
with IOS 12, Car Play will also

1311
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,898
support third-party navigation

1312
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:29,988
apps.

1313
00:43:30,528 --> 00:43:36,358
[ Applause ]

1314
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:38,408
So now you have even more

1315
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:40,008
choices when you use Car Play.

1316
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:42,398
That is a really quick look at

1317
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:44,398
some of our app dates, and

1318
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:45,818
Craig, back to you.

1319
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:45,885
[applause]

1320
00:43:45,885 --> 00:43:46,608
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Susan.

1321
00:43:52,938 --> 00:43:54,538
[applause] Well, now I'd like to

1322
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:55,778
take a moment to talk about

1323
00:43:55,778 --> 00:43:57,198
something that's on a lot of

1324
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,588
people's minds lately.

1325
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,658
You know, iPhone and iPad are

1326
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:03,258
some of the most powerful tools

1327
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:03,258
some of the most powerful tools

1328
00:44:03,648 --> 00:44:05,908
ever created for learning,

1329
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:08,398
exploring, and keeping in touch,

1330
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,178
but some apps demand more of our

1331
00:44:11,178 --> 00:44:12,708
attention than we might even

1332
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:13,318
realize.

1333
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:15,998
They beg us to use our phone

1334
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:16,968
when we really should be

1335
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,258
occupying ourselves with

1336
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:18,958
something else.

1337
00:44:19,038 --> 00:44:20,358
They send us flurries of

1338
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,738
notifications, trying to draw us

1339
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:24,458
in for fear of missing out.

1340
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:27,678
And some of us, it's become such

1341
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:28,998
a habit that, you know, we might

1342
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:30,528
not even recognize just how

1343
00:44:30,528 --> 00:44:31,778
distracted we've become.

1344
00:44:32,638 --> 00:44:34,568
Well, we've thought deeply about

1345
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:36,928
this, and today we're announcing

1346
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:39,558
a comprehensive set of built-in

1347
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:41,478
features to help you limit

1348
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,458
distraction, focus, and

1349
00:44:44,538 --> 00:44:46,318
understand how you're spending

1350
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:48,858
your time and balance the many

1351
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:49,988
things that are important to

1352
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:50,208
you.

1353
00:44:50,848 --> 00:44:52,738
Now it starts with Do Not

1354
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:53,288
Disturb.

1355
00:44:53,688 --> 00:44:55,428
There are times of the day, or

1356
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:56,598
times when you just don't want

1357
00:44:56,598 --> 00:44:57,448
to be disturbed, and one of

1358
00:44:57,448 --> 00:44:59,918
those, of course, is at night.

1359
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:01,558
Sometimes you wake up in the

1360
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:02,638
middle of the night, and you

1361
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:02,638
middle of the night, and you

1362
00:45:02,638 --> 00:45:03,568
look at your phone, maybe just

1363
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:04,888
to check the time, and you're

1364
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:05,938
confronted with something like

1365
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:08,728
this, a barrage of notifications

1366
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:10,228
that spin you up and keep you

1367
00:45:10,278 --> 00:45:11,678
from falling back asleep.

1368
00:45:12,338 --> 00:45:14,478
And so we're introducing Do Not

1369
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,668
Disturb during bedtime where all

1370
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:18,418
you'll see is this.

1371
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:20,678
Nothing to get you spun up.

1372
00:45:20,678 --> 00:45:21,968
And in the morning, yeah.

1373
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:28,038
[ Applause ]

1374
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:29,838
In the morning when you wake up,

1375
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,428
you're gently eased into your

1376
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:31,988
day.

1377
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:33,068
You can tap when you want to

1378
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:34,138
start confronting those

1379
00:45:34,138 --> 00:45:34,928
notifications.

1380
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:39,068
Now we've all found ourselves in

1381
00:45:39,108 --> 00:45:42,648
situations like this.

1382
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:44,218
[laughter] Now, rest assured, he

1383
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:45,748
stuck the landing on this one.

1384
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:49,038
But now Do Not Disturb can help,

1385
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:50,778
and we made it easier than ever

1386
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:51,978
to use Do Not Disturb because

1387
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:53,358
now we have a great new mode

1388
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:54,498
where when you press in to Do

1389
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:55,988
Not Disturb and Control Center,

1390
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:58,048
you can set an ending time for

1391
00:45:58,048 --> 00:45:58,988
Do Not Disturb for when you

1392
00:45:58,988 --> 00:46:00,698
leave a particular location or

1393
00:46:00,698 --> 00:46:02,038
when an event ends on your

1394
00:46:00,698 --> 00:46:02,038
when an event ends on your

1395
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:02,468
calendar.

1396
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,428
So I think we're all going to be

1397
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:05,228
using Do Not Disturb a bunch

1398
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:05,508
more.

1399
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:08,098
Now next I want to talk about

1400
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:08,998
Notifications.

1401
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:12,608
Now, Notifications help keep us

1402
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:13,768
informed and connected to

1403
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:15,178
important things that happen

1404
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:17,418
throughout the day, and we'd

1405
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:18,818
like to give you more control

1406
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,128
over how many notifications you

1407
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:23,468
receive, and so we're enabling

1408
00:46:23,468 --> 00:46:24,998
what we call Instant Tuning for

1409
00:46:24,998 --> 00:46:26,108
Notifications right from the

1410
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:26,868
lock screen.

1411
00:46:27,478 --> 00:46:28,608
You can press in to a

1412
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:30,088
notification, and from there,

1413
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,348
you can decide to send future

1414
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:33,248
notifications from that app

1415
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,688
directly to Notifications

1416
00:46:34,688 --> 00:46:35,988
Center, bypassing your lock

1417
00:46:35,988 --> 00:46:36,338
screen.

1418
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:38,788
Or turn them off altogether, and

1419
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:39,968
Siri will even help by

1420
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:41,368
suggesting that you turn off

1421
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,058
Notifications for apps that

1422
00:46:43,058 --> 00:46:44,198
you're no longer using.

1423
00:46:44,878 --> 00:46:46,658
Now, we also wanted to give you

1424
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:48,448
help managing large numbers of

1425
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:49,338
notifications.

1426
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:51,248
So I'm thrilled to announce that

1427
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:53,578
we're bringing to iOS support

1428
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:54,988
for grouped notifications.

1429
00:46:55,528 --> 00:47:02,908
[ Applause ]

1430
00:46:55,528 --> 00:47:02,908
[ Applause ]

1431
00:47:03,408 --> 00:47:05,148
Notifications are grouped not

1432
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,708
just by app but also by topic

1433
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:08,758
and thread.

1434
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:10,158
It gives you a great overview of

1435
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:11,038
the notifications you've

1436
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:11,528
received.

1437
00:47:12,018 --> 00:47:13,658
You can tap in and look at a

1438
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:14,668
particular group.

1439
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,508
But of course just as important

1440
00:47:17,118 --> 00:47:19,168
with a single swipe, you can

1441
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:20,968
triage a whole group of

1442
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:22,138
notifications away.

1443
00:47:22,378 --> 00:47:23,938
So that's Notifications.

1444
00:47:24,528 --> 00:47:27,718
[ Applause ]

1445
00:47:28,218 --> 00:47:30,218
Now, in addition to these great

1446
00:47:30,368 --> 00:47:32,208
features for helping you limit

1447
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,378
distractions, we wanted to go

1448
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,108
further, and it's with a feature

1449
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:38,128
we call screen time.

1450
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:41,118
Screen time empowers you with

1451
00:47:41,118 --> 00:47:43,398
both insight and control over

1452
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:45,548
how you spend your time, and it

1453
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:47,278
starts with reports.

1454
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:50,048
Every week, you get a weekly

1455
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:52,928
activity summary that details

1456
00:47:53,118 --> 00:47:55,358
how you used your iPhone or

1457
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:55,648
iPad.

1458
00:47:56,548 --> 00:47:58,508
You tap in, and you get to view

1459
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,248
your full activity report.

1460
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,008
It's really detailed.

1461
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:03,538
You get deep insight on how much

1462
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:03,538
You get deep insight on how much

1463
00:48:03,538 --> 00:48:05,088
time you're spending, where

1464
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:06,698
you're spending it, and even how

1465
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:08,058
your use breaks down during the

1466
00:48:08,058 --> 00:48:09,718
day or the night.

1467
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:12,858
You get a summary of the time

1468
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:15,008
you're spending in apps, how

1469
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:17,348
much time you're spending, how

1470
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:18,958
often per hour you're picking up

1471
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,168
your phone and what's drawing

1472
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:23,038
you in and what apps are sending

1473
00:48:23,038 --> 00:48:24,838
you the most notifications.

1474
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,248
Now, equipped with this insight,

1475
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:28,968
you can make decisions about how

1476
00:48:28,968 --> 00:48:30,368
much time you want to spend with

1477
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:31,308
your device each day.

1478
00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:33,108
But we know there are people who

1479
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:35,018
would like a little extra help

1480
00:48:35,018 --> 00:48:36,638
in managing their use of apps,

1481
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:38,418
and for them we've created App

1482
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:39,188
Limits.

1483
00:48:39,688 --> 00:48:41,188
So if in your activity report

1484
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:43,358
you see an app where you might

1485
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:44,308
want to be spending a little bit

1486
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:46,958
less time, well you can set your

1487
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,118
own limit, and then during the

1488
00:48:49,118 --> 00:48:51,468
day, when you're using the app,

1489
00:48:51,468 --> 00:48:52,288
you receive a helpful

1490
00:48:52,288 --> 00:48:53,568
notification letting you know

1491
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:54,678
time is almost up.

1492
00:48:55,528 --> 00:49:03,618
[ Applause ]

1493
00:48:55,528 --> 00:49:03,618
[ Applause ]

1494
00:49:04,118 --> 00:49:05,118
And once you've reached your

1495
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:06,258
limit, instead of the app,

1496
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:08,158
you'll see this.

1497
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:09,158
It's time to move on.

1498
00:49:09,718 --> 00:49:10,608
Now, we'll let you grant

1499
00:49:10,608 --> 00:49:11,758
yourself and extension if you

1500
00:49:11,758 --> 00:49:13,408
want, but we'll give you a

1501
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,808
reminder later to move along.

1502
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:17,598
Now, this is also in sync across

1503
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,008
your iPhone and iPad, so your

1504
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:20,808
limits apply to your total

1505
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:21,398
usage.

1506
00:49:21,698 --> 00:49:22,548
And we think this is going to be

1507
00:49:22,548 --> 00:49:25,638
helpful for many people, but

1508
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:27,568
especially for some kids.

1509
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:30,018
And we know this is something

1510
00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:31,278
that can help families achieve

1511
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:32,998
the right balance for them.

1512
00:49:33,278 --> 00:49:34,488
And of course it starts with

1513
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:35,868
providing your kids with great

1514
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:36,968
information so they get an

1515
00:49:36,968 --> 00:49:38,508
activity report of their own,

1516
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,378
but as a parent, you get one as

1517
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:45,088
well on your device, and based

1518
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:46,618
on what you see, you have the

1519
00:49:46,618 --> 00:49:49,228
option of creating allowances.

1520
00:49:50,528 --> 00:49:56,568
[ Applause ]

1521
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:58,608
Now you have many options.

1522
00:49:58,698 --> 00:50:00,428
One of them is downtime, time

1523
00:50:00,428 --> 00:50:01,418
when you want your kids to

1524
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:02,938
unplug altogether.

1525
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:02,938
unplug altogether.

1526
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:04,628
For instance, at bedtime.

1527
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,648
And you can also limit your

1528
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:10,708
kids' time in apps by category

1529
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,138
or by individual app.

1530
00:50:13,058 --> 00:50:14,218
Now, there's some apps you may

00:50:14,218 --> 00:50:15,598
want to always allow them to

1532
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:15,878
use.

1533
00:50:15,878 --> 00:50:16,948
For instance, you may want them

1534
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:18,248
to be able to get at the phone

1535
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,538
at all times, so they can

1536
00:50:19,538 --> 00:50:20,248
contact you.

1537
00:50:20,248 --> 00:50:21,338
Or you may want to give them

1538
00:50:21,338 --> 00:50:23,298
access to educational apps.

1539
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:25,588
And you can also limit access to

1540
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,938
only movies, apps, and websites

1541
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:30,128
that you deem age appropriate.

1542
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:32,508
Now, this works of course across

1543
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:35,038
their iPhone and iPad, and it's

1544
00:50:35,038 --> 00:50:36,788
uses family sharing, so it's

1545
00:50:36,788 --> 00:50:38,788
super easy to set up, and you

1546
00:50:38,788 --> 00:50:41,008
can manage it all remotely from

1547
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:42,578
your parent parental device.

1548
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:46,378
And so that's are some-- Screen

1549
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:47,868
Time has great features to help

1550
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:48,988
you better manage your time.

Now, next I'd like to talk about

1553
00:50:59,608 --> 00:51:01,318
one of the most important uses

1554
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:03,208
of our devices, and that's

1555
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:03,208
of our devices, and that's

1556
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,368
communication.

1557
00:51:04,368 --> 00:51:06,728
And we'll start with messages.

1558
00:51:07,578 --> 00:51:09,528
Messages has given us fun ways

1559
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:11,378
to express ourselves with emoji

1560
00:51:11,378 --> 00:51:14,128
and now Animoji, and one of the

1561
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:16,128
things that make Animoji so fun

1562
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:17,718
is how expressive they are, you

1563
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:19,678
know, from smiles to frowns, to

1564
00:51:19,678 --> 00:51:21,248
nods of the head and blinking of

1565
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:21,738
the eye.

1566
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:24,638
Animoji does such an amazing job

1567
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:25,908
tracking our expressions.

1568
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:27,598
And this year, we're taking

1569
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:29,468
Animoji to a whole new level,

1570
00:51:29,468 --> 00:51:31,618
the breakthrough new technology

1571
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,338
we call Tongue Detection.

1572

[applause] That's right.

1573
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:40,438
Now, you can make your favorite

Animoji do this.

1575
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:45,138
We're all going to be sticking

1576
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:46,618
out our tongues to our phones in

1577
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:47,288
the near future.

1578
00:51:48,748 --> 00:51:50,128
Now, we've also, we're also

1579
00:51:50,128 --> 00:51:51,498
introducing some great new

1580
00:51:51,498 --> 00:51:52,918
Animoji that I think you're all

1581
00:51:52,918 --> 00:51:54,738
going to love, like ghost,

1582
00:51:56,148 --> 00:52:01,918
koala, tiger, and T-Rex.

1583
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:07,048
But we wanted to take Animoji

1584
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:09,578
even further by making them even

1585
00:52:09,578 --> 00:52:10,378
more personal.

1586
00:52:11,648 --> 00:52:13,688
So I'm thrilled today to

1587
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:15,558
announce the arrival of the era

1588
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:18,188
of Memoji.

00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:19,708
[applause] That's right.

1590
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:25,738
With Memoji you can create your

1591
00:52:25,828 --> 00:52:27,538
very own personalized Animoji.

you or the real you.

1595
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:43,828
And we've worked hard to build a

1596
00:52:43,978 --> 00:52:45,708
deep set of customization

1597
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,228
options to let our customers

1598
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:50,928
create an incredibly diverse set

1599
00:52:51,378 --> 00:52:52,088
of Memoji.

1600
00:52:52,678 --> 00:52:54,308
It's really incredible what you

1601
00:52:54,308 --> 00:52:55,038
can create.

1602
00:52:56,118 --> 00:52:57,448
And we've designed a beautiful

new experience to create these

1604

Let's get started with Animoji.

1619
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:25,158
First, you need to meet the

1620

newest members of the team.

She's so cute.

1624
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:37,328
And now, my personal favorite,

1625
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:39,068
the koala.

cuddly though, so here's our

00:54:08,928 --> 00:54:09,768
is.

1640
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:11,898
I recently chopped my hair, so I

want one that matches the new

me.

1643
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,038
So I've selected a skin color,

1644
00:54:16,038 --> 00:54:18,048
and now I'm trying to figure out

1645
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:19,848
just the right amount of

1646

choose from.

1652

First, I'm going to grab my

1653
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:36,048
color, and then like I said, I

1654
00:54:36,048 --> 00:54:37,958
need to go a little bit shorter.

1655
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:39,008
All right.

Nope, this is the one.

1658
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:46,618
course select my eye color, and

1659
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:48,198
what's really amazing is as I'm

1660

making changes, the character up

1661

to customize.

1664
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:58,698
I could add earrings, but what I

1665
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:00,688
really want is a great pair of

1666

00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:10,648
Ferdinand, yet another tiny dog

1699
00:56:10,648 --> 00:56:10,878
hat.

1700
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:12,448
This isn't even the first.

1701
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:14,798
I think this is the perfect

1702
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:16,458
opportunity for a response with

1703
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:17,978
this new fun camera.

1704
00:56:18,728 --> 00:56:19,848
So I'll tap to pull up the

1705
00:56:19,848 --> 00:56:21,588
camera, and then I can see this

1706
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:22,938
little star over here on the

1707
00:56:22,938 --> 00:56:23,158
left.

1708
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,328
Tapping on that gives me a strip

1709
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:27,768
with all sorts of new effects.

1710
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:29,698
So I could add things like

1711
00:56:29,698 --> 00:56:31,268
shapes or text.

1712
00:56:32,178 --> 00:56:35,088
But let's check out these

1713
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:35,928
filters.

1714
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,628
Ooh. So this is comic book.

1715
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:39,548
It's really fun, but for a

1716
00:56:39,548 --> 00:56:42,108
response about a tiny dog hat, I

1717
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:43,338
think I'm going to go in a

1718
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:44,938
different artistic direction.

1719
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:47,798
So what I really need to do is

1720
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:49,028
add a sticker from one of my

1721
00:56:49,028 --> 00:56:50,078
favorite sticker packs.

1722
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:53,038
Ferdy looked really excited

1723
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:55,198
about that new dog hat, so I'm

1724
00:56:55,198 --> 00:56:58,668
going to put him right here, and

1725
00:56:58,668 --> 00:57:00,688
now we have an all new way for

1726
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,418
you to use Animoji.

1727
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,418
you to use Animoji.

1728
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,198
I can apply my favorite Animoji

1729
00:57:05,198 --> 00:57:07,038
right here live.

1730
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:16,388
[ Applause ]

1731
00:57:16,888 --> 00:57:18,388
Here's the Memoji I just

1732
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:20,358
created, but I actually have

1733
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:21,758
just the one.

1734
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:24,988
It's of me in a very similar red

1735
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:27,398
hat, which is kind of perfect

1736
00:57:27,398 --> 00:57:28,378
for twinning with my pup.

1737
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:34,288
So I'm going to set up my shot,

1738
00:57:34,738 --> 00:57:35,518
snap, and send.

1739
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,158
And that's a demo of the fun new

1740
00:57:38,158 --> 00:57:38,888
effects in messages.

1741
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:39,338
To you Craig.

1742
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:49,578
[ Applause ]

1743
00:57:50,078 --> 00:57:51,558
&gt;&gt; So that's Memoji and some fun

1744
00:57:51,558 --> 00:57:53,408
new effects in the camera and

1745
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:54,048
messages.

1746
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:56,488
Next, let's talk about Facetime.

1747
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,738
Yeah. Facetime is the way that

1748
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:02,218
so many of us connect with the

1749
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:02,218
so many of us connect with the

1750
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:03,798
people in our lives and share

1751
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:04,808
some of our most important

1752
00:58:04,808 --> 00:58:06,468
moments, and it's helped us

1753
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:08,558
deepen our connect with people

1754
00:58:08,558 --> 00:58:10,228
important to us wherever they

1755
00:58:10,228 --> 00:58:12,128
are, and of course it's a fun

1756
00:58:12,128 --> 00:58:13,368
place just to hang out.

1757
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:15,898
Now this year Facetime is going

1758
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:18,238
to take a big leap forward

1759
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:21,128
because today we're introducing

1760
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:22,928
Group Facetime.

1761
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:29,598
[ Applause ]

1762
00:58:30,098 --> 00:58:32,508
Now, you'll be able to facetime

1763
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:36,108
with two people, three people,

1764
00:58:36,998 --> 00:58:40,518
actually up to 32 simultaneous

1765
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:40,988
participants.

1766
00:58:41,528 --> 00:58:44,978
[ Applause ]

1767
00:58:45,478 --> 00:58:48,138
Now, setting up a group call

1768
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:49,268
couldn't be easier.

1769
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:50,628
Just instead of typing one

1770
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,298
person's name, you can do many.

1771
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:53,478
You can ring them by tapping

1772
00:58:53,558 --> 00:58:55,838
audio or video, but we also

1773
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:57,168
introduced a great new way

1774
00:58:57,168 --> 00:58:58,438
because Facetime is now

1775
00:58:58,478 --> 00:59:01,078
integrated into messages, so you

1776
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:03,128
can quickly go from a group chat

1777
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:03,128
can quickly go from a group chat

1778
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:05,618
you have going directly into a

1779
00:59:05,618 --> 00:59:07,748
group Facetime, and members of

1780
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:09,528
the group can join in and drop

1781
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:10,748
out at any time.

1782
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:12,278
It's really great.

1783
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:13,458
Would you like to see it?

1784
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,688
[applause] Well let's do a demo.

1785
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:18,838
[applause] Well I think for our

1786
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:21,668
first live demo of group

1787
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:24,108
Facetime, I'm going to contact

1788
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:25,648
the folks back in Cupertino.

1789
00:59:25,878 --> 00:59:27,318
I can just dive in to this

1790
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:29,318
conversation I have going with

1791
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:30,568
the members of the Facetime

1792
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,428
team, and it looks like actually

1793
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:33,268
they're already on a group

1794
00:59:33,268 --> 00:59:35,518
Facetime call, so I'm just going

1795
00:59:36,008 --> 00:59:41,048
to join right in.

1796
00:59:42,008 --> 00:59:42,648
Hey everybody.

1797
00:59:43,568 --> 00:59:44,678
&gt;&gt; Hey Craig.

1798
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:46,288
&gt;&gt; Check it out.

1799
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:48,428
So it's this beautiful Facetime

1800
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:51,438
UI with these big gorgeous tiles

1801
00:59:51,618 --> 00:59:53,208
right up front where you see

1802
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,448
some of the leaders of the

1803
00:59:54,448 --> 00:59:55,828
Facetime team, and down at the

1804
00:59:55,828 --> 00:59:57,598
bottom there's and area we call

1805
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:59,238
the roster that contains

1806
00:59:59,238 --> 00:59:59,918
everybody else.

1807
00:59:59,918 --> 01:00:01,238
And of course I'm right there in

1808
01:00:01,238 --> 01:00:02,338
the lower right-hand corner.

1809
01:00:01,238 --> 01:00:02,338
the lower right-hand corner.

1810
01:00:03,178 --> 01:00:03,578
&gt;&gt; Hey Craig.

1811
01:00:04,218 --> 01:00:05,778
Wait, am I on the big screen?

1812
01:00:06,248 --> 01:00:07,738
&gt;&gt; Yes, Lauren, this is not a

1813
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:08,648
test.

1814
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,418
You're in front of 6000 of your

1815
01:00:10,418 --> 01:00:10,988
biggest new fans.

1816
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:16,938
[ Applause ]

1817
01:00:17,438 --> 01:00:19,628
Now, what you probably notice is

1818
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:21,078
when Lauren spoke, her tile

1819
01:00:21,178 --> 01:00:23,008
automatically got larger to

1820
01:00:23,008 --> 01:00:24,728
reflect her prominence in the

1821
01:00:24,728 --> 01:00:25,428
conversation.

1822
01:00:25,428 --> 01:00:27,228
This is totally automatic.

1823
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:28,748
Hey Roberto, how's it going back

1824
01:00:28,788 --> 01:00:29,628
there in Cupertino?

1825
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:32,268
&gt;&gt; I'd say it's going pretty

1826
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,208
well, and Lauren, sorry for

1827
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,178
stealing your spotlight.

1828
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:37,308
&gt;&gt; So this works of course for

1829
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:39,158
people in the roster as well.

1830
01:00:39,158 --> 01:00:40,088
When they speak, they come

1831
01:00:40,088 --> 01:00:40,538
forward.

1832
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:41,758
Hey Christopher, you ready to

1833
01:00:41,758 --> 01:00:42,558
make your big entrance?

1834
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:45,028
&gt;&gt; Finally, my moment has come.

1835
01:00:45,178 --> 01:00:45,888
Hello world.

1836
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:49,708
&gt;&gt; Now, well done.

1837
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:53,468
Now you can control this too, so

1838
01:00:53,508 --> 01:00:54,748
I want to bring Woody front and

1839
01:00:54,748 --> 01:00:57,038
center, I just double tab.

1840
01:00:57,038 --> 01:00:57,858
There he is.

1841
01:01:00,438 --> 01:01:01,838
Woody, your baby is performing

1842
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:03,028
admirably here.

1843
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:03,028
admirably here.

1844
01:01:03,348 --> 01:01:04,078
&gt;&gt; Thanks Craig.

1845
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,078
It's exciting to finally be able

1846
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,118
to share Group Facetime with

1847
01:01:06,118 --> 01:01:06,418
everyone.

1848
01:01:06,638 --> 01:01:07,868
&gt;&gt; It sure is.

1849
01:01:07,868 --> 01:01:09,858
Now, we have not only all of

1850
01:01:09,908 --> 01:01:11,708
this, but we've also brought the

1851
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:13,418
fun effects to the Facetime

1852
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,018
camera.

1853
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:16,298
I can just tap in, and I have

1854
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:19,968
access to Animoji, filters, and

1855
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:21,948
all of my sticker packs, and

1856
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,488
everyone else on the call can

1857
01:01:23,488 --> 01:01:24,728
apply them too.

1858
01:01:25,258 --> 01:01:27,198
Now this is the future.

1859
01:01:28,988 --> 01:01:29,338
&gt;&gt; Hey, Craig.

1860
01:01:29,408 --> 01:01:30,988
Check this out, I'm a comic book

1861
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,408
koala, something I've always

1862
01:01:32,408 --> 01:01:33,948
wanted to be.

1863
01:01:33,948 --> 01:01:34,498
[laughter]

1864
01:01:34,498 --> 01:01:35,678
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you've finally been

1865
01:01:35,678 --> 01:01:36,788
able to express that side of

1866
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:37,708
yourself, Roberto.

1867
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:40,038
Hey, Tim, is that you?

1868
01:01:40,338 --> 01:01:41,158
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's me.

1869
01:01:41,158 --> 01:01:42,318
I've signed up to help test

1870
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:42,908
Facetime.

1871
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:43,668
&gt;&gt; All right.

1872
01:01:43,668 --> 01:01:51,038
[applause] Well, well thank you,

1873
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:51,238
Tim.

1874
01:01:51,238 --> 01:01:52,438
Every little bit counts.

1875
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:54,648
&gt;&gt; Happy to help, and thanks to

1876
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:56,288
everyone on the Facetime team

1877
01:01:56,288 --> 01:01:57,578
for making it a reality.

1878
01:01:57,788 --> 01:01:59,918
I can't wait to start using it

1879
01:01:59,918 --> 01:02:01,448
every Sunday night to follow the

1880
01:02:01,558 --> 01:02:05,048
leadership team.

1881
01:02:01,558 --> 01:02:05,048
leadership team.

1882
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:06,098
&gt;&gt; Looking forward to that, Tim.

1883
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:08,328
Of course what I'm really

1884
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:09,728
looking forward to is getting

1885
01:02:09,728 --> 01:02:11,728
Group Facetime to everyone on

1886
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,528
iOS 12.

1887
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,048
Thanks guys for a fantastic

1888
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:14,328
call.

1889
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:14,978
We'll see you back in Cupertino.

1890
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:23,738
[ Applause ]

1891
01:02:24,238 --> 01:02:25,298
So that's Group Facetime.

1892
01:02:26,098 --> 01:02:28,598
It works on iPhone, iPad, and

1893
01:02:28,698 --> 01:02:31,278
Mac, and you can even answer an

1894
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:33,308
audio on your wrist on your

1895
01:02:33,308 --> 01:02:34,188
Apple Watch.

1896
01:02:35,178 --> 01:02:37,478
So that's Facetime and Messages,

1897
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,958
and this is iOS 12.

1898
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,918
Improved performance, new AR

1899
01:02:42,918 --> 01:02:45,868
experiences, Siri Suggestions,

1900
01:02:46,188 --> 01:02:48,688
Screen Time, Memoji and fun

1901
01:02:48,688 --> 01:02:50,168
effects in the Messages camera,

1902
01:02:50,638 --> 01:02:51,948
and Group Facetime.

1903
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:54,068
I hope you like it.

1904
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:55,058
I'm going to hand it back to

1905
01:02:55,148 --> 01:02:55,398
Tim.

1906
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:55,978
Thank you.

1907
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:59,868
[ Applause ]

1908
01:03:00,368 --> 01:03:01,088
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Craig.

1909
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:05,648
IOS 12 looks fantastic, and we

1910
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,338
can't wait for everyone to get

1911
01:03:07,338 --> 01:03:08,768
their hands on it.

1912
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:11,228
Next up, we'd like to talk about

1913
01:03:11,228 --> 01:03:12,748
the Apple Watch.

1914
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:16,598
Yeah. [applause] When we began

1915
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:17,878
development of the watch many

1916
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,878
years ago, we had a vision for

1917
01:03:19,878 --> 01:03:22,228
just how impactful and essential

1918
01:03:22,228 --> 01:03:24,808
it could become in our lives, so

1919
01:03:24,808 --> 01:03:26,878
we worked very hard to create

1920
01:03:26,998 --> 01:03:28,928
something that you would love

1921
01:03:28,928 --> 01:03:30,708
and want to wear all the time,

1922
01:03:31,538 --> 01:03:33,788
and customers do love it.

1923
01:03:33,788 --> 01:03:35,648
In fact, Apple Watch is number

1924
01:03:35,648 --> 01:03:40,228
one in customer satisfaction,

1925
01:03:40,228 --> 01:03:41,228
[applause] and not just this

1926
01:03:41,228 --> 01:03:43,078
year, but every single year

1927
01:03:43,078 --> 01:03:45,778
since we launched in 2015.

1928
01:03:46,308 --> 01:03:48,258
And growth has been off the

1929
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:48,948
charts.

1930
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:52,368
Apple Watch grew 60 percent last

1931
01:03:52,368 --> 01:03:52,698
year.

1932
01:03:53,428 --> 01:03:55,068
We're constantly hearing from

1933
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:57,418
customers about the many ways

1934
01:03:57,418 --> 01:03:59,188
that the Apple Watch has changed

1935
01:03:59,188 --> 01:03:59,878
their lives.

1936
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:02,658
And I'd like to share just one

1937
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:02,658
And I'd like to share just one

1938
01:04:02,658 --> 01:04:04,708
of them with you this morning.

1939
01:04:06,048 --> 01:04:08,708
Mary Dovgen was boating with her

1940
01:04:08,768 --> 01:04:10,968
husband, John, when due to a

1941
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:13,418
medical condition all of John's

1942
01:04:13,418 --> 01:04:15,508
muscles went completely limp,

1943
01:04:15,508 --> 01:04:17,548
and he fell into the ice cold

1944
01:04:17,548 --> 01:04:18,058
water.

1945
01:04:19,048 --> 01:04:20,558
With her arms wrapped around

1946
01:04:20,558 --> 01:04:23,098
John to keep him from drowning,

1947
01:04:23,248 --> 01:04:26,018
Mary could not reach her phone

1948
01:04:26,018 --> 01:04:27,858
to call for help.

1949
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,708
But with her Apple Watch, she

1950
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:33,318
was able to call Siri, or to use

1951
01:04:33,418 --> 01:04:36,678
Siri to call 911, rescuers soon

1952
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:38,948
arrived, and saved John's live.

1953
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:44,178
[ Applause ]

1954
01:04:44,678 --> 01:04:47,438
As Mary told us, if it wasn't

1955
01:04:47,438 --> 01:04:49,988
for my Apple Watch, he really

1956
01:04:49,988 --> 01:04:51,058
would not be here today.

1957
01:04:52,718 --> 01:04:54,188
This is just one of the many

1958
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:55,738
stories that we've heard about

1959
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:57,458
about how Apple Watch is

1960
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,028
impacting people's lives.

1961
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:01,428
They range from getting people

1962
01:05:01,428 --> 01:05:03,038
to be more active, to helping

1963
01:05:01,428 --> 01:05:03,038
to be more active, to helping

1964
01:05:03,038 --> 01:05:06,568
users live a healthier life, or

1965
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:08,308
even to alerting users to an

1966
01:05:08,308 --> 01:05:09,528
elevated heart rate.

1967
01:05:10,058 --> 01:05:12,508
Apple Watch brings such amazing

1968
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,978
capabilities right to the wrist,

1969
01:05:15,508 --> 01:05:16,758
and of course at the heart of

1970
01:05:16,758 --> 01:05:19,218
this is watchOS.

1971
01:05:19,598 --> 01:05:21,218
We're excited to introduce

1972
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:24,028
watchOS 5 today, which brings

1973
01:05:24,078 --> 01:05:25,988
even more ways for you to stay

1974
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,918
active and connected, and I'd

1975
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:30,688
like to hand it off to Kevin

1976
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:32,208
Lynch to tell you all about it.

1977
01:05:32,518 --> 01:05:32,888
Kevin.

1978
01:05:33,528 --> 01:05:38,558
[ Applause ]

1979
01:05:39,058 --> 01:05:40,298
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

1980
01:05:40,298 --> 01:05:41,298
You know, stories like that,

1981
01:05:41,298 --> 01:05:42,488
about how Apple Watch is

1982
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:43,608
supporting people around the

1983
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:46,118
world in even extreme situations

1984
01:05:46,118 --> 01:05:47,468
like Mary and John's but also in

1985
01:05:47,468 --> 01:05:48,948
their daily lives is really

1986
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,208
super motivating to us as a

1987
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:50,548
team.

1988
01:05:50,548 --> 01:05:52,518
And there are things you do

1989
01:05:52,518 --> 01:05:53,918
every day that shape your life.

1990
01:05:54,008 --> 01:05:56,348
And Apple Watch has two

1991
01:05:56,428 --> 01:05:57,278
[inaudible] working to help you

1992
01:05:57,558 --> 01:05:59,058
support those activities every

1993
01:05:59,058 --> 01:05:59,328
day.

1994
01:06:00,648 --> 01:06:01,778
First, staying active to

1995
01:06:01,828 --> 01:06:02,998
increase your well-being and

1996
01:06:01,828 --> 01:06:02,998
increase your well-being and

1997
01:06:02,998 --> 01:06:04,348
health and second being

1998
01:06:04,348 --> 01:06:05,418
connected to the people and the

1999
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:06,578
information that you care most

2000
01:06:06,578 --> 01:06:08,268
about, and we're moving watchOS

2001
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:09,738
in both of these areas.

2002
01:06:10,418 --> 01:06:11,528
Let's start with health and

2003
01:06:11,528 --> 01:06:12,008
fitness.

2004
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:13,608
Now much of the power in the

2005
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:14,738
health and fitness features that

2006
01:06:14,738 --> 01:06:16,668
we've put in Watch are really

2007
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:17,948
empowered by the investment we

2008
01:06:17,948 --> 01:06:20,068
do to make sure the data you see

2009
01:06:20,068 --> 01:06:21,058
is accurate.

2010
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:22,388
The data from our custom-built

2011
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:23,228
heart rate sensor,

2012
01:06:23,228 --> 01:06:25,448
Accelerometer, Gyro, GPS, are

2013
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:26,608
all thoroughly validated.

2014
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:28,468
In fact, from our fitness lab,

2015
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:30,428
we've studied over six terabytes

2016
01:06:30,428 --> 01:06:32,508
of data where 12,000 study

2017
01:06:32,508 --> 01:06:34,478
participants logged over 90,000

2018
01:06:34,478 --> 01:06:35,478
hours of sessions.

2019
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:37,068
And they actually burned 2.3

2020
01:06:37,068 --> 01:06:38,608
million calories doing this.

2021
01:06:39,238 --> 01:06:40,448
We believe this is the largest

2022
01:06:40,448 --> 01:06:41,888
biometric data collection of its

2023
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:42,278
kind.

2024
01:06:42,608 --> 01:06:44,918
And we take this information and

2025
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:45,978
we work to integrate this

2026
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:47,078
seamlessly with the user

2027
01:06:47,078 --> 01:06:48,548
experience so when you raise

2028
01:06:48,548 --> 01:06:49,638
your wrist and you look at your

2029
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,138
activity rings, the information

2030
01:06:51,138 --> 01:06:52,148
is not only accurate, but it's

2031
01:06:52,148 --> 01:06:53,398
also meaningful to you.

2032
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:54,868
We really love hearing about

2033
01:06:54,868 --> 01:06:56,258
your focus on closing these

2034
01:06:56,258 --> 01:06:56,638
rings.

2035
01:06:57,528 --> 01:06:58,608
And we really enable this

2036
01:06:58,608 --> 01:06:59,518
through a number of ways in

2037
01:06:59,518 --> 01:07:00,188
Apple Watch.

2038
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:02,678
First, of course, we do daily

2039
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:02,678
First, of course, we do daily

2040
01:07:02,678 --> 01:07:03,718
coaching so you can see what

2041
01:07:03,718 --> 01:07:04,798
your goals are for the day.

2042
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:06,838
We also support celebrations

2043
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:08,988
when you achieve your goals, and

2044
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:09,888
we have special edition

2045
01:07:09,888 --> 01:07:11,508
challenges like the most recent

2046
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:13,188
birthday challenge that we did.

2047
01:07:13,598 --> 01:07:15,248
And on a monthly basis, we do

2048
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:16,198
monthly goals that are

2049
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,268
personalized to you.

2050
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:19,638
And of course the activity app

2051
01:07:19,638 --> 01:07:21,088
also supports activity sharing,

2052
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:22,378
which has become one of the most

2053
01:07:22,378 --> 01:07:23,838
popular features of the activity

2054
01:07:23,988 --> 01:07:24,318
app.

2055
01:07:24,688 --> 01:07:27,068
Many of you love the excitement

2056
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,088
of good old-fashioned

2057
01:07:28,088 --> 01:07:29,528
competition though, so in

2058
01:07:29,528 --> 01:07:31,428
watchOS 5, you can challenge any

2059
01:07:31,428 --> 01:07:32,948
of your activity-sharing friends

2060
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,338
to a seven-day competition

2061
01:07:34,338 --> 01:07:35,058
whenever you would like.

2062
01:07:35,058 --> 01:07:37,508
And if they accept, you each try

2063
01:07:37,508 --> 01:07:39,018
to win the week by closing your

2064
01:07:39,018 --> 01:07:40,078
rings and earning points.

2065
01:07:40,338 --> 01:07:41,308
You earn one point for each

2066
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:42,118
percent of a ring that you

2067
01:07:42,118 --> 01:07:42,528
close.

2068
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:44,108
And while you're in the middle

2069
01:07:44,108 --> 01:07:45,658
of a competition, your progress

2070
01:07:45,658 --> 01:07:47,158
notifications are updated, do

2071
01:07:47,158 --> 01:07:48,448
not only show you the progress

2072
01:07:48,448 --> 01:07:49,598
your friends are making, but

2073
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,798
also where you stand in the

2074
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:51,518
competition.

2075
01:07:52,058 --> 01:07:54,888
And when you win, you receive a

2076
01:07:54,888 --> 01:07:55,388
new award.

2077
01:07:55,918 --> 01:07:57,038
We're really excited about this

2078
01:07:57,038 --> 01:07:57,728
edition, and if you're

2079
01:07:57,728 --> 01:07:58,618
competition, it gives you a

2080
01:07:58,618 --> 01:07:59,958
whole new way to enjoy the

2081
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:01,488
activity app.

2082
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:02,508
Now when you're doing

2083
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:02,508
Now when you're doing

2084
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:08,568
[applause]-- now when you do

2085
01:08:08,568 --> 01:08:09,708
want to go do a workout, there's

2086
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:10,898
a lot of workout types you can

2087
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,618
choose from, and they all have

2088
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:13,888
custom algorithms to measure

2089
01:08:13,888 --> 01:08:15,478
things like calorie burn, pace,

2090
01:08:15,478 --> 01:08:17,228
distance, elevation gain, and

2091
01:08:17,228 --> 01:08:18,088
when you're swimming, it even

2092
01:08:18,088 --> 01:08:19,428
counts laps and detects which

2093
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,538
swim strokes you're using.

2094
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:22,388
And with Gym Kit, your metrics

2095
01:08:22,388 --> 01:08:23,768
are in sync with your favorite

2096
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:24,407
gym equipment.

2097
01:08:24,638 --> 01:08:25,558
And we're really excited to

2098
01:08:25,558 --> 01:08:26,498
bring more enhancements to

2099
01:08:26,498 --> 01:08:29,058
workouts in watchOS 5, starting

2100
01:08:29,058 --> 01:08:30,308
with a new workout type for

2101
01:08:30,308 --> 01:08:30,938
yoga.

2102
01:08:31,128 --> 01:08:32,348
Now this works primarily from

2103
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:34,737
your heart rate, and we

2104
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:36,268
calibrate this to your fitness

2105
01:08:36,268 --> 01:08:37,607
through the rest of your day, so

2106
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:38,538
now you can more accurately

2107
01:08:38,538 --> 01:08:40,107
track those yoga sessions

2108
01:08:40,107 --> 01:08:41,628
including those intense Vinyasa

2109
01:08:41,668 --> 01:08:42,038
sessions.

2110
01:08:42,648 --> 01:08:44,697
New we've also added a new

2111
01:08:44,697 --> 01:08:46,178
workout type for hiking.

2112
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:47,998
This takes into account pace and

2113
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,688
heart rate and elevation gain so

2114
01:08:49,788 --> 01:08:50,817
you can more accurately get

2115
01:08:50,817 --> 01:08:52,067
exercise credit while you're

2116
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:53,768
hiking on steep terrain or

2117
01:08:53,768 --> 01:08:54,638
really long stages.

2118
01:08:55,348 --> 01:08:58,737
And Apple watch has become a

2119
01:08:58,737 --> 01:09:00,548
really great running companion

2120
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:01,828
especially now that we've added

2121
01:09:01,828 --> 01:09:03,758
GPS and cellular and music

2122
01:09:01,828 --> 01:09:03,758
GPS and cellular and music

2123
01:09:03,758 --> 01:09:04,378
streaming.

2124
01:09:04,378 --> 01:09:05,508
And we're making this an even

2125
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:06,898
better experience now for

2126
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:08,178
training runs and races.

2127
01:09:08,718 --> 01:09:09,678
In addition to current and

2128
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:11,078
average pace, you now have the

2129
01:09:11,078 --> 01:09:12,468
option to keep track of your

2130
01:09:12,468 --> 01:09:14,138
rolling mile pace, which is how

2131
01:09:14,138 --> 01:09:15,447
fast you ran the immediately

2132
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:16,277
preceding mile.

2133
01:09:16,998 --> 01:09:18,188
You can also now set a custom

2134
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:19,888
pace alert, so your Apple watch

2135
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:20,828
will tap you when you're above

2136
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:21,728
or below the pace that you've

2137
01:09:21,728 --> 01:09:22,038
set.

2138
01:09:22,928 --> 01:09:24,248
And finally, runners will now

2139
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:25,758
get cadence so you can see your

2140
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:26,848
current steps per minute.

2141
01:09:26,848 --> 01:09:28,378
We're really excited for runners

2142
01:09:28,378 --> 01:09:29,518
to try these out.

2143
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:30,918
Now--

2144
01:09:31,527 --> 01:09:35,947
[ Applause ]

2145
01:09:36,447 --> 01:09:37,538
Now there are sometimes when you

2146
01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:38,588
forget to start a workout on

2147
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:39,458
watch, but you've started

2148
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:41,188
working out, and to solve this

2149
01:09:41,188 --> 01:09:42,828
now, we're adding automatic

2150
01:09:42,828 --> 01:09:43,777
workout detection.

2151
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:49,567
[ Applause ]

2152
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:50,987
So your Apple Watch will now

2153
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:52,118
offer to start tracking your

2154
01:09:52,118 --> 01:09:53,268
workout if it senses that you're

2155
01:09:53,268 --> 01:09:53,868
beginning one.

2156
01:09:54,048 --> 01:09:55,338
And even if you press start

2157
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:56,878
sometime after you began working

2158
01:09:56,878 --> 01:09:58,558
out, you'll get retroactive

2159
01:09:58,638 --> 01:09:59,718
credit for the workouts that you

2160
01:09:59,718 --> 01:10:00,038
did.

Apple Watch.

2166
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:11,158
Now when you reduce the

2167
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:12,268
intensity of your movement or

2168
01:10:12,268 --> 01:10:13,848
your heart rate decreases but

2169
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:15,058
you forget to end your workout,

2170
01:10:15,058 --> 01:10:16,608
of course Watch will also detect

2171
01:10:16,638 --> 01:10:17,898
that and suggest that you stop.

2172
01:10:18,528 --> 01:10:23,418
[ Applause ]

2173
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:25,268

automatic workout detection are

2178
01:10:32,298 --> 01:10:33,598
all enabling you to more

2179
01:10:33,598 --> 01:10:34,888
accurately track your workouts

2180
01:10:34,888 --> 01:10:36,878
and stay motivated while you do.

2181
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:38,838
Now let's talk about being

2182
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:39,488
connected.

2183
01:10:40,508 --> 01:10:41,618
Apple Watch enables you to

2184
01:10:41,618 --> 01:10:43,268
remain in the moment while also

2185
01:10:43,268 --> 01:10:44,768
easily connected to the people

2186
01:10:44,768 --> 01:10:45,778
and information that you care

2187
01:10:45,778 --> 01:10:46,198
about.

2188
01:10:46,698 --> 01:10:47,938
And the introduction of cellular

2189
01:10:47,938 --> 01:10:49,138
made this even better.

2190
01:10:49,138 --> 01:10:50,428
You can stay connected even when

2191
01:10:50,428 --> 01:10:51,528
you're going out for an evening,

2192
01:10:51,608 --> 01:10:52,998
running some errands, or even

2193
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,028
going for a swim.

2194
01:10:54,558 --> 01:10:55,728
Or, stay in touch when your

2195
01:10:55,728 --> 01:10:56,698
phone might not be easily

2196
01:10:56,698 --> 01:10:57,308
available to you.

2197
01:10:58,328 --> 01:10:59,378
And staying connected with

2198
01:10:59,378 --> 01:11:00,558

Apple Watch.

2202
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:03,918
You can easily make or receive a

2203
01:11:03,918 --> 01:11:05,238
phone call, and you can hear the

2204

emotion and tone at the other

real time.

2207
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,828
Or you can use Messages to have

2208
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:12,898
impromptu, short conversations

In watchOS 5, you'll have an

2212
01:11:16,998 --> 01:11:18,568
entirely new way to communicate

2213
01:11:18,568 --> 01:11:19,178
on your watch.

2214
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:20,988
That's real-time voice but with

2215
01:11:20,988 --> 01:11:22,258
a spontaneity of short

2216
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:22,758
messaging.

2217
01:11:23,358 --> 01:11:30,648

&gt;&gt; Introducing Walkie Talkie.

01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:45,558
[ Applause ]

2223
01:11:46,058 --> 01:11:47,238
This is a new app by Apple

2224

Watch.

2225
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,318
It's fun, easy way to talk with

2226
01:11:49,318 --> 01:11:50,088
friends and family.

2227
01:11:50,418 --> 01:11:51,298
Let's take a look at how it

2228
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:51,658
works.

2229
01:11:52,528 --> 01:11:53,558
First you choose who you'd like

2230
01:11:53,558 --> 01:11:54,748
to enable Walkie Talkie with,

2231
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,428
and it suggests some people that

2232
01:11:56,428 --> 01:11:57,618
you often communicate with, so

2233
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:58,488
you could easily add them.

2234
01:11:58,488 --> 01:12:00,318
Now the first time that you do

2235
01:12:00,318 --> 01:12:01,588
this, your friend will receive a

2236
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:03,108
one-time request to allow a

2237
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:03,108
one-time request to allow a

2238
01:12:03,108 --> 01:12:04,228
walkie talkie connection with

2239
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:04,508
you.

2240
01:12:04,848 --> 01:12:06,238
If they accept, then you can

2241
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,218
speak to each other with walkie

2242
01:12:07,218 --> 01:12:08,218
talkie whenever you like.

2243
01:12:08,218 --> 01:12:10,438
And to do this, you just press

2244
01:12:10,478 --> 01:12:12,538
to talk, and then your friend

2245
01:12:12,538 --> 01:12:13,918
can hear your voice just like a

2246
01:12:13,918 --> 01:12:14,498
walkie talkie.

2247
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:16,868
And they're going to feel a

2248
01:12:16,868 --> 01:12:17,558
[inaudible] beep beep sound

2249
01:12:17,558 --> 01:12:18,548
right before your voice comes

2250
01:12:18,548 --> 01:12:18,918
out.

2251
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,448
And this new watch-to-watch

2252
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:21,938
connection works over cellular

2253
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:23,588
or Wi-Fi, and it has really high

2254
01:12:23,588 --> 01:12:24,378
audio quality.

2255
01:12:24,378 --> 01:12:25,348
And it's a lot of fun.

2256
01:12:25,348 --> 01:12:26,338
We can't wait for you to try

2257
01:12:26,338 --> 01:12:26,918
this out.

2258
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:27,828
That's walkie talkie.

[ Applause ]

2260
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:35,338
Now last year we introduced a

2261
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:36,778
Siri watch face, which presents

2262
01:12:36,778 --> 01:12:37,778
the right information to you at

2263
01:12:37,778 --> 01:12:38,468
the right time.

2264
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:40,278
And Siri does this using machine

2265
01:12:40,278 --> 01:12:41,148
learning, so it's going to get

2266
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,018
better at predicting your

2267
01:12:42,018 --> 01:12:43,738
actions over time by combining

2268
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:45,548
inputs like the time of day,

2269
01:12:45,548 --> 01:12:46,908
your location, your daily

2270
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:48,308
routines, or which apps you use

2271
01:12:48,308 --> 01:12:48,578
when.

2272
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:49,848
We're making some great

2273
01:12:49,848 --> 01:12:51,448
enhancements to the Siri watch

2274
01:12:51,448 --> 01:12:51,928
face now.

2275
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:54,048
First, we're adding new content.

2276
01:12:54,048 --> 01:12:55,468
So now you can get live sports

2277
01:12:55,468 --> 01:12:57,028
scores, you can get commute time

2278
01:12:57,028 --> 01:12:58,768
home or to work, or you can see

2279
01:12:58,768 --> 01:13:00,098
your heart rate, for example,

2280
01:13:00,098 --> 01:13:01,688
after a workout or your resting

2281
01:13:01,688 --> 01:13:02,778
heart rate.

2282
01:13:01,688 --> 01:13:02,778
heart rate.

2283
01:13:03,488 --> 01:13:05,088
And we're also adding Siri

2284
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:05,588
Shortcuts.

2285
01:13:05,588 --> 01:13:06,778
So the shortcuts you saw coming

2286
01:13:06,778 --> 01:13:08,778
to iOS 12 are also going to be

2287
01:13:08,778 --> 01:13:09,868
available in watchOS.

2288
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:11,408
So in addition to getting

2289
01:13:11,408 --> 01:13:12,938
relevant information, you'll

2290
01:13:12,938 --> 01:13:14,558
also receive predicted shortcuts

2291
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,058
right on the Siri watch face.

2292
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:17,738
So in a wrist raise, you'll be

2293
01:13:17,738 --> 01:13:19,248
able to directly do things like

2294
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,078
turn on your leaving home scene

2295
01:13:21,118 --> 01:13:22,978
or start an outdoor walk or play

2296
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:24,428
your favorite morning playlist.

2297
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:26,228
And these shortcuts app based on

2298
01:13:26,598 --> 01:13:27,808
whether you typically do those

2299
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:29,268
actions at those times.

2300
01:13:29,468 --> 01:13:30,858
So super easy now to just tap

2301
01:13:30,858 --> 01:13:31,808
and do those actions.

2302
01:13:32,248 --> 01:13:34,598
Also for the first time, you can

2303
01:13:34,598 --> 01:13:36,458
now use third party apps on the

2304
01:13:36,548 --> 01:13:37,568
Siri watch face.

2305
01:13:38,068 --> 01:13:39,458
So now you can see both relevant

2306
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,698
content and shortcuts from your

2307
01:13:40,698 --> 01:13:40,988
favorite apps.

01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:56,028

01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:57,578
your wrist and tap, it's that

2316

easy.

2319
01:14:02,048 --> 01:14:03,558
making for an even more powerful

Siri watch phase.

01:14:06,298 --> 01:14:08,318
Now currently to talk to Siri

2322
01:14:08,468 --> 01:14:09,248
you raise your wrist and you

2323
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:10,398
say, hey Siri.

2324
01:14:10,438 --> 01:14:11,588
And when you think about this,

2325
01:14:11,758 --> 01:14:12,908
it's quite a strong signal when

2326
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:14,178
you raise your wrist and talk to

2327
01:14:14,178 --> 01:14:14,848
your watch.

2328
01:14:14,848 --> 01:14:15,758
It's kind of like when someone's

2329
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:16,808
standing right in front of you,

2330
01:14:16,978 --> 01:14:17,778
you don't need to say hey

2331
01:14:17,778 --> 01:14:18,688
because you have their attention

2332
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:20,498
already, so we're bringing this

2333
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,648
same social cue to Siri on the

2334
01:14:22,648 --> 01:14:25,128
watch so you no longer need to

2335
01:14:25,178 --> 01:14:25,868
say, hey Siri.

2336
01:14:26,898 --> 01:14:28,058
You just raise your wrist and

2337
01:14:28,058 --> 01:14:28,608
talk to Siri.

01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:36,968
improvements to Notifications,

2341
01:14:37,318 --> 01:14:38,548
which are now more actionable

2342
01:14:38,548 --> 01:14:39,258
and interactive.

2343
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:40,918
So, for example, with this

2344
01:14:40,918 --> 01:14:42,528
notification from Quantis, you

2345
01:14:42,528 --> 01:14:43,568
can check in and share your

2346
01:14:43,568 --> 01:14:44,868
flight details right from the

2347

2348
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:47,548
After you finish a ride with

2349
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:49,148
Dee, you can scroll down.

2350
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:50,658
You can rate your ride and pay

2351
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:52,268
with Apple Pay right there in

2352
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:53,028
the notification.

2353
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:55,088
And with this one from Yelp that

2354
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:56,368
your table is ready, if you need

2355
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:57,628
a bit more time, you can extend

2356
01:14:57,628 --> 01:14:58,928
the reservation out a bit just

2357
01:14:58,928 --> 01:14:59,588
by tapping here.

2358
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:01,568
So super easy now to interact

2359
01:15:01,568 --> 01:15:02,518
right in place inside

2360
01:15:01,568 --> 01:15:02,518

2364
01:15:07,228 --> 01:15:08,218
Today if someone sends you a

2365
01:15:08,218 --> 01:15:09,848
weblink, you aren't able to view

2366
01:15:09,848 --> 01:15:10,408

With watchOS 5, we've integrated

01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:14,278
WebKit, so now you have the

2369
01:15:14,278 --> 01:15:16,118
ability to view web content and

2370
01:15:16,118 --> 01:15:17,208
mail or messages.

2371
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:19,608
You can even tap on that link,

2372
01:15:20,258 --> 01:15:22,368
yes, to easily view things like

2373
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:23,308
menus here.

2374
01:15:23,378 --> 01:15:25,578
And while we think full browsing

2375
01:15:25,578 --> 01:15:26,418
doesn't make sense on your

2376
01:15:26,418 --> 01:15:27,738
wrist, there are times you get

2377
01:15:27,788 --> 01:15:28,158
content.

2378
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:29,048
You'd like to see it right in

2379
01:15:29,048 --> 01:15:30,258
the moment, and now you'll be

2380
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:31,718
able to do that and watch OS 5.

2381
01:15:31,888 --> 01:15:32,768
And the contents can be

2382
01:15:32,768 --> 01:15:34,168
formatted for the small screen,

2383
01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:35,248
and the where reader made is

2384
01:15:35,248 --> 01:15:36,328
available, it uses that on the

2385
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:36,818
watch.

2386
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:38,768

Now with watchOS 4, we

2389
01:15:47,098 --> 01:15:48,558
introduced an entirely new way

2390
01:15:48,558 --> 01:15:49,668
to listen to music while you're

2391
01:15:49,668 --> 01:15:50,468
on the go.

2392
01:15:50,468 --> 01:15:52,108
You can stream 48 million songs

2393
01:15:52,108 --> 01:15:53,088
on your wrist with Apple, or you

2394
01:15:53,088 --> 01:15:54,678
can listen to automatically

2396
01:15:56,668 --> 01:15:58,988
And now with watchOS 5, we're

2397
01:15:58,988 --> 01:15:59,928
giving you even more to listen

2398
01:15:59,928 --> 01:15:59,995
to.

The Apple podcast app is coming

2403
01:16:07,828 --> 01:16:08,808
to Apple Watch.

2404
01:16:09,318 --> 01:16:10,538
Upcoming episodes from

2405
01:16:10,538 --> 01:16:11,808
subscribed podcasts will be

2406
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:12,938
automatically synced to your

2407
01:16:12,938 --> 01:16:14,298
watch, so you can get them right

2408
01:16:14,298 --> 01:16:16,648
there, or you can just ask Siri

2409
01:16:16,648 --> 01:16:18,008
to stream a podcast for you, and

2410
01:16:18,008 --> 01:16:19,758
it'll start playing and playback

2411
01:16:19,758 --> 01:16:21,328
resume across all your devices

2412
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,638
so you can continue just where

01:16:22,638 --> 01:16:23,288
you left off.

2414
01:16:23,718 --> 01:16:24,638
So that's Podcast.

2415
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:26,898
Now those are the great new

2416
01:16:26,898 --> 01:16:28,398
features coming in watchOS 5.

2417
01:16:28,398 --> 01:16:30,078
So stay connected with people

Now we'd like to show you this

2425
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:41,638
stuff live in action, and we

2426
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:42,618
thought we'd increase the

2427
01:16:42,618 --> 01:16:43,928

2428

2432
01:16:49,978 --> 01:16:50,798
going to do the demo while

01:17:04,658 --> 01:17:05,718
I've got some great stuff to

2443
01:17:05,718 --> 01:17:06,668
show you that I think you're

2444
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,328
really going to love, and the

2445
01:17:08,328 --> 01:17:09,788
bonus is, I get to work on

2446
01:17:09,788 --> 01:17:11,948
closing my rings while I do it.

2447
01:17:11,948 --> 01:17:14,078
So, first, I'm super excited to

2448
01:17:14,078 --> 01:17:15,688
show you how easy it is to start

2449
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:16,968
a workout with GymKit.

2450
01:17:16,968 --> 01:17:20,728
I just tap to connect and accept

2451
01:17:20,728 --> 01:17:22,308
on the watch, and now I can

2452
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:24,658
control and start the workout

2453
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:25,928
right here from the console on

2454
01:17:25,928 --> 01:17:26,448
the bike.

2455
01:17:26,998 --> 01:17:28,858
All of my data between the watch

2456
01:17:28,918 --> 01:17:30,428
and the bike is in sync, and all

2457
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:31,538
of my workout metrics are

2458
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:31,998
accurate.

2459
01:17:32,918 --> 01:17:34,058
Now, I wouldn't typically be

2460
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:35,298
trying to demo things for you

2461
01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:36,348
and sneak in a workout at the

2462
01:17:36,348 --> 01:17:37,928
same time, but I want to show

2463
01:17:37,928 --> 01:17:39,438
you activity competitions.

2464
01:17:39,438 --> 01:17:41,548
And to do that, I need to keep

2465
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:41,998
moving.

2466
01:17:42,308 --> 01:17:43,558
This morning I got this

2467
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,598
notification, and it says, your

2468
01:17:46,598 --> 01:17:48,208
competition with Jay is down to

2469
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,648
the last day, and it's a close

one.

2471
01:17:50,338 --> 01:17:51,348
Have you got what it takes to

2472
01:17:51,348 --> 01:17:51,598
win?

2473
01:17:51,598 --> 01:17:53,318
Have I got what it takes?

2474
01:17:53,318 --> 01:17:53,988

But if I scroll down, I can see

2477
01:17:59,728 --> 01:18:00,888
that Jay has moved ahead of me

2478
01:18:00,888 --> 01:18:02,028
by a couple of points, and

2479
01:18:00,888 --> 01:18:02,028
by a couple of points, and

2480
01:18:02,028 --> 01:18:03,128
that's not okay because this

2481
01:18:03,128 --> 01:18:04,058
thing ends tonight.

2482
01:18:04,298 --> 01:18:05,768
So, I think I'm going to add a

2483
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,388
little resistance to this

2484
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:09,168
workout here and work to earn as

2485
01:18:09,168 --> 01:18:10,548
many points as possible and move

2486
01:18:10,548 --> 01:18:11,618
ahead of Jay by the time this

2487
01:18:11,618 --> 01:18:12,358
demo is done.

him a little smack talk to let

him know I'm coming for him.

2491

Let me show you interactive

2492
01:18:21,808 --> 01:18:23,588
notifications because I have a

2493
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:24,818
dinner reservation tonight that

2494
01:18:24,818 --> 01:18:25,828
I made through Yelp.

2495
01:18:26,048 --> 01:18:27,478
If all goes well here, I'm going

2496
01:18:27,478 --> 01:18:28,508
to go out with my girlfriends

2497
01:18:28,508 --> 01:18:29,558
from work to celebrate.

2498
01:18:29,558 --> 01:18:31,618
And because we all know that Jay

2499
01:18:31,618 --> 01:18:32,418
is going to lose this

2500
01:18:32,418 --> 01:18:33,658
competition, maybe I should

2501
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:35,728
invite him along so it can be

2502
01:18:35,728 --> 01:18:36,408
his treat.

2503

Now I can simply add to the

01:19:31,098 --> 01:19:32,378
workout that I'm in right now,

2536
01:19:32,528 --> 01:19:34,228
and when I'm ready to get back

2537
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,158
to it, I can just tap.

2538
01:19:35,808 --> 01:19:37,538
Next up is Glow Baby, because

2539
01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:38,748
it's about this time each day

2540
01:19:38,748 --> 01:19:40,198
that I check the app to see if

2541
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:41,188
my husband has logged our

2542
01:19:41,188 --> 01:19:41,828
one-year-old's nap.

2543
01:19:43,018 --> 01:19:44,168
Oh, good job, baby.

2544
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:46,108
You slept two hours, and you

2545
01:19:46,108 --> 01:19:47,228
parents know that good naps

2546
01:19:47,358 --> 01:19:48,488
equal good nights, so I'm

2547
01:19:48,488 --> 01:19:50,338
looking forward to that.

2548
01:19:50,338 --> 01:19:52,728
AR. As I scroll through my day,

2549
01:19:52,828 --> 01:19:54,678
I can see my next meeting.

2550
01:19:54,678 --> 01:19:56,308
I can see traffic and directions

2551
01:19:56,308 --> 01:19:57,518
to places that I'm going later

2552
01:19:57,518 --> 01:19:57,968
today.

2553
01:19:57,968 --> 01:20:00,568
Here's that dinner that Siri

2554
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:02,328
found in my calendar, and

2555
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:02,328
found in my calendar, and

2556
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:03,878
waiting for me at the end of my

2557
01:20:03,878 --> 01:20:05,768
day is a shortcut to my evening

2558
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:07,388
meditation or ten percent

2559
01:20:07,388 --> 01:20:08,668
happier, nice.

2560
01:20:09,978 --> 01:20:11,208
Now, I want to check back in on

2561
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:12,858
this competition, but I thought

2562
01:20:12,858 --> 01:20:14,118
it might be a good idea to get a

2563
01:20:14,118 --> 01:20:15,498
little moral support from my

2564
01:20:15,498 --> 01:20:16,338
number one fan.

2565
01:20:16,918 --> 01:20:18,138
And you heard Kevin say how

2566
01:20:18,138 --> 01:20:19,808
walkie talkie is so great for

2567
01:20:19,808 --> 01:20:20,838
staying in touch with close

2568
01:20:20,838 --> 01:20:21,508
friends and family.

2569
01:20:21,778 --> 01:20:23,488
So I set my daughter up with

2570
01:20:23,488 --> 01:20:25,308
walkie talkie so that she can

2571
01:20:25,308 --> 01:20:26,458
help demo what it's like to

2572
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,208
receive one and maybe give me a

2573
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:29,108
little bit of love up here.

2574
01:20:29,108 --> 01:20:30,708
Oh, there she is.

2575
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:36,908
&gt;&gt; Mommy, I see you on TV.

2576
01:20:36,908 --> 01:20:38,908
&gt;&gt; Isn't that fun?

2577
01:20:38,908 --> 01:20:40,098
How am I doing?

2578
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:42,728
&gt;&gt; So good.

2579
01:20:42,728 --> 01:20:44,458
I know you'll beat Uncle Jay,

2580
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,928
#mommyforthewin.

2581
01:20:48,168 --> 01:20:49,238
&gt;&gt; Thanks Peach.

2582
01:20:49,298 --> 01:20:49,738
I love you.

2583
01:20:50,528 --> 01:20:57,558
[ Applause ]

2584
01:20:58,058 --> 01:20:59,438
And that's how walkie talkie

2585
01:20:59,628 --> 01:20:59,988
works.

2586
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,668
AR. The time is now to check in

2587
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,668
AR. The time is now to check in

2588
01:21:02,668 --> 01:21:04,618
on this competition and see if I

2589
01:21:04,618 --> 01:21:06,258
have done enough to pull ahead.

2590
01:21:06,338 --> 01:21:08,058
I'm going to tap into activity

2591
01:21:08,218 --> 01:21:09,478
and swipe over to see the score.

2592
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:10,988
Oh, yes.

[ Applause ]

2594
01:21:17,738 --> 01:21:19,838
Sorry Jay, but the day is still

2595
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:20,008
young.

2596
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:21,498
Thanks everybody, and back to

2597
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:21,838
you, Kevin.

[ Applause ]

2599
01:21:29,368 --> 01:21:30,098
&gt;&gt; Way to go, Jules.

2600
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:32,558
So in watchOS 5 we've enabled

2601
01:21:32,558 --> 01:21:34,218
even deeper integration on the

2602
01:21:34,218 --> 01:21:36,038
watch for apps, enabling them to

2603
01:21:36,038 --> 01:21:37,138
work right in the moment.

2604
01:21:37,138 --> 01:21:39,288
And apps can include interactive

2605
01:21:39,288 --> 01:21:41,048
controls within notifications so

2606
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:42,648
you can quickly do more without

2607
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,198
even opening an app like extend

2608
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:45,348
your parking with Pay by Phone.

2609
01:21:45,448 --> 01:21:47,378
And with Shortcuts, there's also

2610
01:21:47,378 --> 01:21:48,228
new opportunities for

2611
01:21:48,318 --> 01:21:49,838
third-party apps to appear on

2612
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:50,978
Apple Watch right on the watch

2613
01:21:50,978 --> 01:21:51,208
face.

2614
01:21:51,648 --> 01:21:52,848
You can tap on a shortcut on the

2615
01:21:52,848 --> 01:21:54,858
Siri face to order coffee, rent

2616
01:21:54,858 --> 01:21:56,058
a bike, or pick up where you

2617
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:57,438
left off in a workout.

2618
01:21:57,678 --> 01:21:58,768
You can even use your custom

2619
01:21:58,768 --> 01:22:00,468
Siri commands that you created

2620
01:22:00,468 --> 01:22:01,998
on your phone to speak on your

2621
01:22:01,998 --> 01:22:02,428
watch.

2622
01:22:01,998 --> 01:22:02,428
watch.

2623
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:04,518
And for native apps building

2624
01:22:04,518 --> 01:22:05,918
rich experiences, we've improved

2625
01:22:05,918 --> 01:22:07,218
the workout API for greater

2626
01:22:07,218 --> 01:22:09,038
performance, and we've added the

2627
01:22:09,038 --> 01:22:10,698
ability for third-party apps to

2628
01:22:10,698 --> 01:22:11,988
play background audio.

2629

[ Applause ]

2630
01:22:17,478 --> 01:22:18,698
This enables you to easily sync

2631
01:22:18,698 --> 01:22:19,878
things, of course, like audio

2632
01:22:19,878 --> 01:22:21,328
books, favorite playlists,

2633
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,308
guided meditations right to your

2634
01:22:23,398 --> 01:22:24,378
watch and to be able to play

2635
01:22:24,378 --> 01:22:25,908
continuously in the background.

2636
01:22:26,518 --> 01:22:27,728
Now there are so many other

2637
01:22:27,728 --> 01:22:28,998
features coming into watchOS

2638
01:22:28,998 --> 01:22:30,168
including things like the

2639
01:22:30,168 --> 01:22:31,388
ability to customize the button

2640
01:22:31,388 --> 01:22:32,638
arrangement in your control

2641
01:22:32,638 --> 01:22:34,348
center, or you can add an air

2642
01:22:34,348 --> 01:22:35,438
quality complication to your

2643
01:22:35,438 --> 01:22:36,868
watch face, but one really

2644
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:38,548
exciting one is student ID

2645
01:22:38,548 --> 01:22:38,938
cards.

2646
01:22:39,438 --> 01:22:40,768
You're going to have the ability

2647
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,378
to add your student ID card to

2648
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:44,508
wallet on your iPhone and Apple

2649
01:22:44,508 --> 01:22:45,028
Watch.

2650
01:22:45,988 --> 01:22:47,428
And this works by simply holding

2651
01:22:47,428 --> 01:22:49,028
your watch near a meter anywhere

2652
01:22:49,028 --> 01:22:50,078
you can use your student ID

2653
01:22:50,078 --> 01:22:51,648
cards on and off campus.

2654
01:22:51,988 --> 01:22:53,258
You can get access to places

2655
01:22:53,428 --> 01:22:55,748
like your dorm or the library or

2656
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:56,738
events on campus.

2657
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:58,008
You can even pay for things like

2658
01:22:58,008 --> 01:22:59,688
snacks or laundry or dinners,

2659
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:01,088
and this works with your watch

2660
01:23:01,088 --> 01:23:02,698
or your phone, and it will be

2661
01:23:01,088 --> 01:23:02,698
or your phone, and it will be

2662
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:04,718
available this fall starting

2663
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:06,108
with these universities and will

2664
01:23:06,108 --> 01:23:07,618
expand to more campuses over

2665
01:23:07,618 --> 01:23:07,918

We made a beautiful new face

2674
01:23:29,148 --> 01:23:30,378
that matches perfectly with the

2675

available today.

Next up is Apple TV.

Apple TV business has grown an

2703
01:24:18,988 --> 01:24:21,048
incredible 50 percent.

2704
01:24:21,978 --> 01:24:23,668
Today, we've got some great new

2705
01:24:23,668 --> 01:24:26,068
enhancements to Apple TV 4K and

2706
01:24:26,068 --> 01:24:27,628
tvOS, and we think you're going

2707
01:24:27,628 --> 01:24:28,438
to love them.

2708
01:24:28,718 --> 01:24:31,738
So I'd like to invite Apple TV

2709
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:33,738
lead designer, Jen Fuls

2710
01:24:33,738 --> 01:24:34,728
[phonetic] to the stage to tell

2711
01:24:34,728 --> 01:24:35,458
you all about it.

2712
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:36,038
Jen. [applause]

2713
01:24:36,448 --> 01:24:37,748
&gt;&gt; Thanks Tim.

2714
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,688
[ Applause ]

2715
01:24:42,188 --> 01:24:43,418
Apple TV is built on an

2716
01:24:43,418 --> 01:24:45,768
incredible platform, tvOS.

2717
01:24:45,898 --> 01:24:48,758
And tvOS is built specifically

2718
01:24:48,788 --> 01:24:50,208
for the living room, to make it

2719
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:52,208
easy to enjoy your favorite TV

2720
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:54,888
shows, movies, apps, and games.

2721
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:56,728
Now as Tim mentioned, last

2722
01:24:56,918 --> 01:24:58,898
September, we introduced Apple

2723
01:24:58,898 --> 01:25:01,538
TV 4K with the goal of bringing

2724
01:25:01,538 --> 01:25:03,298
the highest quality cinematic

2725
01:25:01,538 --> 01:25:03,298
the highest quality cinematic

2726
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,278
experience right to your home.

2727
01:25:06,378 --> 01:25:09,018
It offers both 4K and high

2728
01:25:09,018 --> 01:25:11,018
dynamic range, including support

2729
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:13,048
for HDR 10 and Dolby Vision.

2730
01:25:14,018 --> 01:25:16,098
Time said, the new Apple TV is a

2731
01:25:16,098 --> 01:25:18,608
high fidelity powerhouse.

2732
01:25:18,638 --> 01:25:20,398
And to ensure you can enjoy this

2733
01:25:20,508 --> 01:25:22,068
beautiful experience with as

2734
01:25:22,068 --> 01:25:25,638
much content as possible, iTunes

2735
01:25:25,638 --> 01:25:28,068
offers the largest collection of

2736
01:25:28,148 --> 01:25:29,728
4K HDR movies.

2737
01:25:30,528 --> 01:25:33,978
[ Applause ]

2738
01:25:34,478 --> 01:25:35,788
And we've upgraded your

2739
01:25:35,788 --> 01:25:37,208
previously purchased movies to

2740
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:39,898
4K HDR for free on all available

2741
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:40,348
titles.

2742
01:25:41,598 --> 01:25:44,208
There are also, thank you, there

2743
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:46,848
are also many 4K and HDR TV

2744
01:25:46,848 --> 01:25:48,418
shows available from popular

2745
01:25:48,418 --> 01:25:50,488
services like Amazon Prime video

2746
01:25:50,488 --> 01:25:51,108
and Netflix.

2747
01:25:52,688 --> 01:25:54,188
And we know what makes for an

2748
01:25:54,188 --> 01:25:56,378
amazing cinematic experience is

2749
01:25:56,378 --> 01:25:58,318
not just great picture quality.

2750
01:25:58,758 --> 01:26:00,758
It's also incredible sound.

2751
01:26:00,758 --> 01:26:04,498
So Apple TV 4K is bringing you

2752
01:26:00,758 --> 01:26:04,498
So Apple TV 4K is bringing you

2753
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:06,638
the latest in audio technology,

2754
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:09,988
Dolby Atmos.

2755
01:26:12,528 --> 01:26:17,128
[ Applause ]

2756
01:26:17,628 --> 01:26:20,328
With Atmos, you get room-filling

2757
01:26:20,328 --> 01:26:20,818
sound.

2758
01:26:21,118 --> 01:26:22,648
The perfect complement to the

2759
01:26:22,698 --> 01:26:25,078
stunning visuals of Apple TV 4K.

2760
01:26:25,748 --> 01:26:27,818
Now what makes Atmos so special

2761
01:26:28,408 --> 01:26:29,798
is that unlike a traditional

2762
01:26:29,858 --> 01:26:30,958
surround sound setup, where

2763
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:32,378
sound is assigned to channels

2764
01:26:32,378 --> 01:26:33,548
like the left or the right,

2765
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:36,688
Dolby Atmos has the ability to

2766
01:26:36,688 --> 01:26:38,738
completely immerse you.

2767
01:26:39,248 --> 01:26:40,798
Atmos moves sound in

2768
01:26:40,798 --> 01:26:41,978
three-dimensional space,

2769
01:26:42,408 --> 01:26:43,768
creating an experience with

2770
01:26:43,848 --> 01:26:46,018
powerful audio that flows all

2771
01:26:46,018 --> 01:26:46,418
around you.

2772
01:26:47,038 --> 01:26:48,698
It puts you right in the center

2773
01:26:48,698 --> 01:26:49,358
of the action.

2774
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:52,128
All this with a home theater

2775
01:26:52,128 --> 01:26:54,388
setup as simple as a Dolby Atmos

2776
01:26:54,388 --> 01:26:56,578
enabled soundbar and an Apple TV

2777
01:26:56,638 --> 01:26:56,968
4K.

2778
01:26:57,798 --> 01:27:00,568
In fact, Apple TV 4K is the only

2779
01:27:00,568 --> 01:27:01,778
streaming player to be both

2780
01:27:01,828 --> 01:27:03,448
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos

2781
01:27:01,828 --> 01:27:03,448
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos

2782
01:27:03,588 --> 01:27:03,988
certified.

2783
01:27:04,528 --> 01:27:09,718
[ Applause ]

2784
01:27:10,218 --> 01:27:11,928
And this Fall, iTunes will be

2785
01:27:11,928 --> 01:27:13,398
bringing you the largest

2786
01:27:13,398 --> 01:27:15,638
collection of Atmos content

2787
01:27:15,638 --> 01:27:15,908
anywhere.

2788
01:27:15,908 --> 01:27:18,808
And just like with 4K HDR, your

2789
01:27:19,388 --> 01:27:20,738
iTunes libraries will be

2790
01:27:20,738 --> 01:27:22,758
upgraded to include Dolby Atmos

2791
01:27:22,798 --> 01:27:24,988
on all supported titles for

2792
01:27:25,488 --> 01:27:29,658
free.

2793
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:30,508
[applause] Now of course these

2794
01:27:30,508 --> 01:27:32,268
movies and so much more are

2795
01:27:32,268 --> 01:27:34,068
available in the Apple TV app.

2796
01:27:35,298 --> 01:27:37,388
The Apple TV app is the center

2797
01:27:37,388 --> 01:27:39,268
of your video experience, a

2798
01:27:39,398 --> 01:27:41,238
single place to find and watch

2799
01:27:41,278 --> 01:27:42,438
what you love across your

2800
01:27:42,528 --> 01:27:43,298
favorite apps.

2801
01:27:43,928 --> 01:27:46,218
It's on Apple TV, iPad and

2802
01:27:46,328 --> 01:27:47,978
iPhone where you can find not

2803
01:27:47,978 --> 01:27:49,528
only On Demand TV shows and

2804
01:27:49,528 --> 01:27:51,578
movies but also live content

2805
01:27:51,948 --> 01:27:53,018
including sports.

2806
01:27:53,538 --> 01:27:55,198
The Apple TV app now offers a

2807
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:58,098
huge range of live sports.

2808
01:27:59,178 --> 01:28:01,148
And we've added live news to

2809
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:02,898
make it even easier to stay

2810
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:02,898
make it even easier to stay

2811
01:28:02,898 --> 01:28:03,188
current.

2812
01:28:04,438 --> 01:28:06,398
The edition of live sports and

2813
01:28:06,398 --> 01:28:07,458
news providers brings the

2814
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:09,128
coverage of the TV app to over

2815
01:28:09,128 --> 01:28:12,508
100 video channels, giving you a

2816
01:28:12,688 --> 01:28:14,728
massive selection of content all

2817
01:28:14,728 --> 01:28:15,528
in one place.

2818
01:28:16,368 --> 01:28:18,258
With all this, Apple TV is the

2819
01:28:18,258 --> 01:28:20,278
best box to connect to your TV.

2820
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:22,378
And that's now more true than

2821
01:28:22,378 --> 01:28:24,208
ever as more and more cable

2822
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:26,268
companies fundamentally shift

2823
01:28:26,628 --> 01:28:27,988
how video gets to your TV.

2824
01:28:28,478 --> 01:28:29,948
This typical cable box is

2825
01:28:29,988 --> 01:28:33,038
becoming a thing of the past as

2826
01:28:33,088 --> 01:28:34,288
these companies embrace

2827
01:28:34,288 --> 01:28:35,648
internet-based delivery.

2828
01:28:36,248 --> 01:28:38,478
And many of them share our

2829
01:28:38,478 --> 01:28:40,688
vision of Apple TV as the one

2830
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:43,118
device for live, On Demand, and

2831
01:28:43,148 --> 01:28:45,678
Cloud DVR content.

2832
01:28:45,678 --> 01:28:46,608
And we've already started

2833
01:28:46,608 --> 01:28:48,088
working with partners around the

2834
01:28:48,088 --> 01:28:49,498
world to make this a reality.

2835
01:28:50,968 --> 01:28:52,408
In France, we're working with

2836
01:28:52,468 --> 01:28:53,178
Canal Plus.

2837
01:28:54,258 --> 01:28:55,648
Almost a third of French

2838
01:28:55,648 --> 01:28:57,048
households subscribe to Canal

2839
01:28:57,118 --> 01:28:59,108
services, and their subscribers

2840
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,658
can now choose Apple TV to

2841
01:29:00,788 --> 01:29:02,548
access more than 100 live

2842
01:29:00,788 --> 01:29:02,548
access more than 100 live

2843
01:29:02,548 --> 01:29:04,908
channels and some of the biggest

2844
01:29:04,908 --> 01:29:06,658
sports including the French Open

2845
01:29:06,658 --> 01:29:07,248
in 4K.

2846
01:29:08,248 --> 01:29:11,218
In Switzerland, we've partnered

2847
01:29:11,218 --> 01:29:11,768
with Salt.

2848
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:13,958
Salt just launched a new TV

2849
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:16,048
service with more than 300 live

2850
01:29:16,098 --> 01:29:18,238
TV channels, and it's available

2851
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:20,328
exclusively on Apple TV.

2852
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:23,618
And I'm really excited to

2853
01:29:23,618 --> 01:29:24,678
announce that here in the U.S.,

2854
01:29:24,908 --> 01:29:26,538
Charter Spectrum will be coming

2855
01:29:26,538 --> 01:29:27,988
to Apple TV late this year.

2856
01:29:28,528 --> 01:29:33,768
[ Applause ]

2857
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:36,538
That means that up to 50 million

2858
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:37,908
homes will be able to choose

2859
01:29:37,908 --> 01:29:40,028
Apple TV to access all their

2860
01:29:40,028 --> 01:29:41,998
live channels and thousands of

2861
01:29:41,998 --> 01:29:42,938
On Demand programs.

2862
01:29:43,548 --> 01:29:45,338
And, they'll be able to use Siri

2863
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,568
and the TV app to get access to

2864
01:29:47,568 --> 01:29:49,338
their TV service not only on

2865
01:29:49,338 --> 01:29:53,938
Apple TV but on iPhone and iPad

2866
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:54,358
as well.

2867
01:29:54,358 --> 01:29:55,568
Now with nearly any cable

2868
01:29:55,568 --> 01:29:57,338
subscription, you can get access

2869
01:29:57,428 --> 01:29:59,928
to dozens of video channels like

2870
01:29:59,928 --> 01:30:02,638
ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many

2871
01:29:59,928 --> 01:30:02,638
ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many

2872
01:30:02,638 --> 01:30:04,848
more, but it used to be really

2873
01:30:04,848 --> 01:30:06,908
painful to set up, having to

2874
01:30:06,908 --> 01:30:08,168
authenticate each app

2875
01:30:08,388 --> 01:30:09,158
individually.

2876
01:30:09,388 --> 01:30:10,528
I'm sure all of you have seen

2877
01:30:10,528 --> 01:30:11,938
that six-digit code you have to

2878
01:30:11,938 --> 01:30:13,408
go online and type into a web

2879
01:30:13,448 --> 01:30:13,738
browser.

2880
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:16,498
Well, last year we introduced

2881
01:30:16,498 --> 01:30:17,268
single sign-on.

2882
01:30:17,938 --> 01:30:19,848
Enter your cable credentials

2883
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:22,268
only once, and we unlock all of

2884
01:30:22,268 --> 01:30:23,578
the apps your subscription

2885
01:30:23,578 --> 01:30:24,198
supports.

2886
01:30:24,948 --> 01:30:26,938
Well now we're making it even

2887
01:30:26,938 --> 01:30:29,988
easier with zero sign-ons.

2888
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:34,718
[ Applause ]

2889
01:30:35,218 --> 01:30:36,888
So now if you're on your TV

2890
01:30:36,888 --> 01:30:38,238
provider's broadband network,

2891
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:40,838
we'll securely and automatically

2892
01:30:40,878 --> 01:30:42,728
unlock all the supported apps

2893
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:44,038
included with your TV service.

2894
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,868
No credentials needed.

2895
01:30:45,868 --> 01:30:47,348
It just works.

2896
01:30:48,438 --> 01:30:49,508
Charter Spectrum [applause]--

2897
01:30:49,628 --> 01:30:53,598
this is really awesome-- and

2898
01:30:53,598 --> 01:30:54,828
Charter Spectrum will be the

2899
01:30:54,938 --> 01:30:56,248
first to support zero sign-on

2900
01:30:56,538 --> 01:30:57,458
and we'll be adding more

2901
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:58,458
providers over time.

2902
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:01,098
We're also giving you even more

2903
01:31:01,098 --> 01:31:02,708
options for ways to control your

2904
01:31:01,098 --> 01:31:02,708
options for ways to control your

2905
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:03,248
Apple TV.

2906
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:05,878
For example, you can get quick

2907
01:31:05,878 --> 01:31:07,558
access on your iPhone where

2908
01:31:07,558 --> 01:31:09,058
Apple TV users will get the

2909
01:31:09,058 --> 01:31:11,068
Apple TV remote automatically

2910
01:31:11,138 --> 01:31:12,118
added to control center.

2911
01:31:12,838 --> 01:31:14,888
And, for those that have

2912
01:31:14,888 --> 01:31:16,358
installed home control systems,

2913
01:31:16,678 --> 01:31:17,828
we're working with the leading

2914
01:31:17,828 --> 01:31:19,308
providers so that you can use

2915
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:20,758
their remotes to control your

2916
01:31:20,838 --> 01:31:23,078
Apple TV, even including support

2917
01:31:23,078 --> 01:31:23,568
for Siri.

2918
01:31:24,308 --> 01:31:28,438
At Apple, I love working with an

2919
01:31:28,438 --> 01:31:30,468
amazing team designing for a

2920
01:31:30,468 --> 01:31:32,238
product that I enjoy every day

2921
01:31:32,348 --> 01:31:34,188
and on the biggest screen in my

2922
01:31:34,308 --> 01:31:34,588
home.

2923
01:31:35,218 --> 01:31:38,598
I get to watch all my favorite

2924
01:31:38,598 --> 01:31:40,628
movies, TV shows and more.

2925
01:31:41,828 --> 01:31:44,348
Over 40 million songs including

2926
01:31:44,348 --> 01:31:46,608
the best metal on Apple Music.

2927
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:49,948
All of my photos, videos, and

2928
01:31:49,948 --> 01:31:52,848
memories as well as thousands of

2929
01:31:52,848 --> 01:31:54,968
apps and games that many of you

2930
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:55,358
have built.

2931
01:31:56,268 --> 01:31:59,248
And, Apple TV brings some

2932
01:31:59,308 --> 01:32:01,868
amazing views right to my living

2933
01:32:01,868 --> 01:32:03,008
room with Aerials.

2934
01:32:01,868 --> 01:32:03,008
room with Aerials.

2935
01:32:04,348 --> 01:32:05,688
Now, one of the questions I get

2936
01:32:05,688 --> 01:32:07,348
asked the most about Aerials,

2937
01:32:07,348 --> 01:32:08,838
especially by my family members

2938
01:32:08,838 --> 01:32:10,518
is where is this?

2939
01:32:10,798 --> 01:32:12,968
Well, this ball with just a tap

2940
01:32:13,138 --> 01:32:15,128
of the Siri remote, you'll now

2941
01:32:15,128 --> 01:32:17,238
be able to see every Arial

2942
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:17,688
location.

2943
01:32:18,528 --> 01:32:23,138
[ Applause ]

2944
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:25,198
And, you can even swipe between

2945
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:27,498
locations so you can see even

2946
01:32:27,498 --> 01:32:27,808
more.

2947
01:32:27,808 --> 01:32:31,498
And today, I have an incredible

2948
01:32:31,498 --> 01:32:33,148
new location to share with you.

2949
01:32:33,148 --> 01:32:36,418
For the past year, we've been

2950
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:38,088
collaborating closely with an

2951
01:32:38,088 --> 01:32:40,058
amazing partner, filming some

2952
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:41,688
stunning footage from around the

2953
01:32:41,688 --> 01:32:44,228
world with a very unique vantage

2954
01:32:44,318 --> 01:32:48,728
point, and here it is.

2955
01:32:48,918 --> 01:32:48,998
Earth.

2956
01:32:51,528 --> 01:32:57,218
[ Applause ]

2957
01:32:57,718 --> 01:32:59,438
This is filmed by astronauts

2958
01:32:59,438 --> 01:33:01,168
aboard the International Space

2959
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:01,878
Station.

2960
01:33:02,168 --> 01:33:03,718
You can see Sicily just off the

2961
01:33:03,718 --> 01:33:05,408
boot of Italy, and check out

2962
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,618
that Mediterranean Sea.

2963
01:33:06,618 --> 01:33:08,528
The blue is just phenomenal.

2964
01:33:08,528 --> 01:33:10,648
So here's a fun fact.

2965
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:12,958
The Space Station makes an orbit

2966
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:15,038
every 90 minutes, so that means

2967
01:33:15,088 --> 01:33:17,938
they get 16 sunrises and sunsets

2968
01:33:17,938 --> 01:33:18,368
every day.

2969
01:33:18,368 --> 01:33:20,708
And with all those sunsets,

2970
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:23,218
nighttime can be particularly

2971
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:24,498
stunning the way those urban

2972
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:25,668
areas pop with light.

2973
01:33:26,448 --> 01:33:27,678
Here we are flying over South

2974
01:33:27,748 --> 01:33:28,808
Korea toward Japan.

2975
01:33:29,608 --> 01:33:31,078
You can see Tokyo coming into

2976
01:33:31,078 --> 01:33:33,018
view at the top, some distant

2977
01:33:33,058 --> 01:33:35,308
stars, and even upper reaches of

2978
01:33:35,308 --> 01:33:36,628
the Earth's atmosphere, which is

2979
01:33:36,628 --> 01:33:38,318
that orange band enveloping the

2980
01:33:39,108 --> 01:33:39,178
Earth.

2981
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:44,688
And here's one that might look a

2982
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:45,738
little more familiar.

2983
01:33:45,978 --> 01:33:47,648
This is the Northern California

2984
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,178
coast heading southward.

2985
01:33:49,908 --> 01:33:50,998
You can see Lake Tahoe

2986
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:53,658
surrounded by snowcaps and the

2987
01:33:53,658 --> 01:33:54,508
San Francisco Bay.

2988
01:33:56,108 --> 01:33:58,978
These are truly incredible and

2989
01:33:58,978 --> 01:34:00,708
offer such a unique perspective

2990
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:01,238
on the world.

2991
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,598
I'd like to give a huge thanks

2992
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,598
I'd like to give a huge thanks

2993
01:34:03,718 --> 01:34:05,038
to the International Space

2994
01:34:05,038 --> 01:34:07,238
Station National Lab and CASIS

2995
01:34:07,238 --> 01:34:08,558
for all their help in making

2996
01:34:08,618 --> 01:34:09,618
this a possibility.

2997
01:34:10,528 --> 01:34:15,858
[ Applause ]

2998
01:34:16,358 --> 01:34:17,558
These are going to look

2999
01:34:17,748 --> 01:34:21,378
incredible at home in 4K HDR.

3000
01:34:22,608 --> 01:34:23,698
So that's tvOS.

3001
01:34:23,698 --> 01:34:26,838
Apple TV gives you amazing

3002
01:34:26,838 --> 01:34:29,558
picture and sound with 4K HDR

3003
01:34:29,558 --> 01:34:31,078
and now Dolby Atmos.

3004
01:34:31,848 --> 01:34:33,328
And the Apple TV app is the

3005
01:34:33,528 --> 01:34:35,428
center of your video experience.

3006
01:34:35,868 --> 01:34:38,338
Available on Apple TV, iPad, and

3007
01:34:38,338 --> 01:34:40,088
iPhone, it's the one place to

3008
01:34:40,088 --> 01:34:41,868
find all your favorite TV shows,

3009
01:34:42,138 --> 01:34:43,688
movies, sports, and news.

3010
01:34:43,688 --> 01:34:45,378
And with that, I'll hand it back

3011
01:34:45,378 --> 01:34:45,548
to Tim.

3012
01:34:45,608 --> 01:34:45,838
Thank you.

3013
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:49,918
[ Applause ]

3014
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:51,248
&gt;&gt; Thanks Jen.

3015
01:34:53,408 --> 01:34:57,358
Apple TV 4K and tvOS look and

3016
01:34:57,468 --> 01:34:58,668
sound awesome.

3017
01:34:58,908 --> 01:35:00,648
You're really going to love it.

3018
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:02,038
Next up is the Mac.

3019
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:02,038
Next up is the Mac.

3020
01:35:03,248 --> 01:35:05,418
At Apple [applause]-- yeah.

3021
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:08,038
We love the Mac.

3022
01:35:08,868 --> 01:35:10,708
The Mac was the first computer

3023
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:13,668
that made powerful technology so

3024
01:35:13,668 --> 01:35:16,068
easy to use and put the customer

3025
01:35:16,068 --> 01:35:18,088
at the center of the experience.

3026
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:19,748
And of course that remains at

3027
01:35:19,748 --> 01:35:21,398
the core of all Apple products.

3028
01:35:21,398 --> 01:35:25,588
For more than 30 years, the Mac

3029
01:35:25,588 --> 01:35:27,558
has empowered people to create

3030
01:35:27,558 --> 01:35:29,918
all kinds of amazing things,

3031
01:35:30,938 --> 01:35:33,148
from the personal to the

3032
01:35:33,148 --> 01:35:33,988
professional.

3033
01:35:34,648 --> 01:35:36,718
Today, we're excited to take Mac

3034
01:35:36,718 --> 01:35:38,618
a huge leap forward.

3035
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:41,168
The next version of macOS is

3036
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:42,918
chock full of new features

3037
01:35:42,918 --> 01:35:45,258
inspired by pro-users but

3038
01:35:45,258 --> 01:35:46,868
designed for everyone.

3039
01:35:47,288 --> 01:35:49,268
I'd like to bring Craig back up

3040
01:35:49,318 --> 01:35:49,868
to talk about it.

3041
01:35:49,868 --> 01:35:49,988
Craig.

3042
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:56,568
[ Applause ]

3043
01:35:57,068 --> 01:35:59,838
&gt;&gt; Hello again.

3044
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:01,588
It's true that macOS is the

3045
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:04,408
heart of what makes a Mac a Mac.

3046
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:04,408
heart of what makes a Mac a Mac.

3047
01:36:05,518 --> 01:36:07,648
And we want as many Mac users as

3048
01:36:07,688 --> 01:36:09,198
possible to have access to our

3049
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:11,138
latest software, and that's why

3050
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,888
six years ago with the

3051
01:36:12,888 --> 01:36:15,168
introduction of OS 10 Mavericks,

3052
01:36:15,498 --> 01:36:17,108
we began offering our macOS

3053
01:36:17,108 --> 01:36:19,578
updates free for Mac users.

3054
01:36:19,578 --> 01:36:21,668
And 2013 was also the year that

3055
01:36:21,668 --> 01:36:23,248
we first introduced our

3056
01:36:23,248 --> 01:36:25,118
California naming theme.

3057
01:36:26,048 --> 01:36:27,998
Now after spending a year by the

3058
01:36:27,998 --> 01:36:30,048
ocean, we not only modernized

3059
01:36:30,088 --> 01:36:31,888
the look and feel of macOS, but

3060
01:36:32,428 --> 01:36:34,218
we headed to the mountains with

3061
01:36:34,218 --> 01:36:36,028
macOS Yosemite.

3062
01:36:37,278 --> 01:36:40,088
Now, as you may be aware, our

3063
01:36:40,088 --> 01:36:41,658
naming of Mac releases is

3064
01:36:41,658 --> 01:36:43,628
handled by our crack marketing

3065
01:36:43,628 --> 01:36:46,778
organization, and as you've

3066
01:36:46,778 --> 01:36:48,468
probably noticed, they went on a

3067
01:36:48,748 --> 01:36:51,018
four-year mountain-bound bender.

3068
01:36:52,948 --> 01:36:54,188
[laughter] In El Capitan we

3069
01:36:54,188 --> 01:36:56,348
added metal, our ground-breaking

3070
01:36:56,348 --> 01:36:57,638
graphics technology.

3071
01:36:58,148 --> 01:36:59,708
In Sierra, we brought Siri to

3072
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:00,948
the Mac and extended our

3073
01:37:00,948 --> 01:37:02,718
capabilities and continuity.

3074
01:37:00,948 --> 01:37:02,718
capabilities and continuity.

3075
01:37:03,278 --> 01:37:05,478
And last year with High Sierra,

3076
01:37:05,678 --> 01:37:07,578
we focused on deep technology,

3077
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:09,338
preparing the Mac for future

3078
01:37:09,338 --> 01:37:09,898
innovation.

3079
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:12,158
Well this year, we made some

3080
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:15,258
striking changes to macOS, and

3081
01:37:15,258 --> 01:37:17,458
we've left the high country for

3082
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:19,318
a place entirely different but

3083
01:37:19,318 --> 01:37:22,058
not less beautiful and here

3084
01:37:22,058 --> 01:37:24,058
still in California, and I'd

3085
01:37:24,058 --> 01:37:25,298
like to take you there now.

3086
01:37:26,168 --> 01:37:32,188
Our next release of macOS is

3087
01:37:32,188 --> 01:37:34,018
macOS Mojave.

3088
01:37:35,528 --> 01:37:41,568
[ Applause ]

3089
01:37:42,068 --> 01:37:43,958
Now, Mojave is beautiful during

3090
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:45,378
the day, but what really

3091
01:37:45,378 --> 01:37:47,498
captured our imagination was the

3092
01:37:47,498 --> 01:37:49,898
beauty of the desert at night.

3093
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:54,578
And this inspired one of our

3094
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:57,168
most distinctive new features,

3095
01:37:57,838 --> 01:38:01,738
and I'd like to show it to you

3096
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:02,738
now.

3097
01:38:04,808 --> 01:38:07,858
So here we are live in macOS

3098
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:10,548
Mojave, and I'd like to show you

3099
01:38:11,288 --> 01:38:13,018
a new side of Mojave.

3100
01:38:14,068 --> 01:38:16,228
We call it dark mode.

3101
01:38:17,528 --> 01:38:24,788
[ Applause ]

3102
01:38:25,288 --> 01:38:27,488
And as you see, dark mode is not

3103
01:38:27,488 --> 01:38:29,108
just about the dock or the menu

3104
01:38:29,108 --> 01:38:29,398
bar.

3105
01:38:29,398 --> 01:38:30,518
It extends to your Windows

3106
01:38:30,518 --> 01:38:32,158
Chrome, your sidebar, and even

3107
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:34,208
the content of the Windows, and

3108
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:35,538
it's so great for Pros.

3109
01:38:35,538 --> 01:38:37,268
It makes photographic content

3110
01:38:37,718 --> 01:38:40,368
absolutely pop off the screen.

3111
01:38:40,658 --> 01:38:42,128
It's just gorgeous.

3112
01:38:42,908 --> 01:38:46,128
It's so nice.

3113
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:48,398
And this is great not just for

3114
01:38:48,398 --> 01:38:50,648
photography but when working on

3115
01:38:50,738 --> 01:38:53,088
presentations or documents.

3116
01:38:53,598 --> 01:38:55,118
It's also great doing ordinary

3117
01:38:55,178 --> 01:38:55,518
things.

3118
01:38:55,578 --> 01:38:56,718
Maybe you're working in a dark

3119
01:38:56,718 --> 01:38:57,258
environment.

3120
01:38:57,798 --> 01:38:59,178
Just look at calendar.

3121
01:39:00,178 --> 01:39:02,748
Even mail in dark mode.

3122
01:39:00,178 --> 01:39:02,748
Even mail in dark mode.

3123
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:03,638
It's so great.

3124
01:39:04,618 --> 01:39:06,218
And I think some of us are going

3125
01:39:06,218 --> 01:39:07,458
to want to run dark mode just

3126
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:09,138
because it's so cool.

3127
01:39:09,328 --> 01:39:11,838
I mean your emoji look great.

3128
01:39:11,838 --> 01:39:13,338
Your photos look great.

3129
01:39:13,528 --> 01:39:15,598
I mean check out your album art

3130
01:39:15,968 --> 01:39:18,778
and music or your For You feed

3131
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:20,298
in Apple Music.

3132
01:39:20,718 --> 01:39:21,968
But I think one audience that's

3133
01:39:21,968 --> 01:39:23,378
going to especially appreciate

3134
01:39:23,378 --> 01:39:24,538
dark mode are some of you here

3135
01:39:24,538 --> 01:39:26,758
in this room, our developers,

3136
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,808
because Expo looks fantastic in

3137
01:39:29,128 --> 01:39:29,668
dark mode.

3138
01:39:30,528 --> 01:39:35,108
[ Applause ]

3139
01:39:35,608 --> 01:39:37,758
Whether it's your source code or

3140
01:39:37,758 --> 01:39:39,408
even interface builder and all

3141
01:39:39,408 --> 01:39:41,478
of its inspectors, they just

3142
01:39:41,478 --> 01:39:43,838
look fantastic in black.

3143
01:39:43,838 --> 01:39:46,678
And that's a quick look at dark

3144
01:39:46,678 --> 01:39:46,978
mode.

3145
01:39:48,258 --> 01:39:51,298
Now, we were so inspired by this

3146
01:39:51,668 --> 01:39:53,938
changing desktop wallpaper that

3147
01:39:54,218 --> 01:39:55,588
we decided to add a new feature

3148
01:39:55,588 --> 01:39:56,978
to Mojave that I think you'll

3149
01:39:56,978 --> 01:39:57,738
enjoy.

3150
01:39:58,408 --> 01:40:00,688
It's called dynamic desktop, and

3151
01:40:00,688 --> 01:40:01,588
when you're using it, you're

3152
01:40:01,588 --> 01:40:03,848
desktop actually subtly changes

3153
01:40:01,588 --> 01:40:03,848
desktop actually subtly changes

3154
01:40:03,918 --> 01:40:06,208
throughout the day from morning,

3155
01:40:06,718 --> 01:40:09,678
to afternoon, to evening.

3156
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:11,388
It's really cool.

3157
01:40:12,098 --> 01:40:14,298
Now, there's much more to Mojave

3158
01:40:14,298 --> 01:40:16,118
that I'd like to share with you

3159
01:40:17,148 --> 01:40:18,718
through demos, and it starts

3160
01:40:19,628 --> 01:40:20,598
with the desktop.

3161
01:40:21,738 --> 01:40:25,428
Now, the desktop is so crucial

3162
01:40:25,428 --> 01:40:27,198
to how many of us use our Macs.

3163
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:28,088
When we have files that we're

3164
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:29,798
actively working on, we often

3165
01:40:29,798 --> 01:40:31,478
put them on the desktop, but the

3166
01:40:31,478 --> 01:40:33,488
result can be a desktop that

3167
01:40:33,488 --> 01:40:34,978
looks something like this.

3168
01:40:36,758 --> 01:40:38,158
And so now in Mojave we have a

3169
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,388
really great solution, and we

3170
01:40:40,388 --> 01:40:43,118
call it Desktop Stacks.

3171
01:40:45,528 --> 01:40:48,588
[ Applause ]

3172
01:40:49,088 --> 01:40:50,728
All of the contents of your

3173
01:40:50,808 --> 01:40:53,428
desktop are automatically

3174
01:40:53,428 --> 01:40:55,648
arranged into these stacks, and

3175
01:40:55,648 --> 01:40:58,538
they can be arranged by kind, by

3176
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:00,868
date, or even by tag, and

3177
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:02,268
they're really easy to use.

3178
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:02,268
they're really easy to use.

3179
01:41:02,368 --> 01:41:03,458
You just click on them.

3180
01:41:03,618 --> 01:41:04,938
You can see all the contents in

3181
01:41:04,938 --> 01:41:05,388
the stack.

3182
01:41:05,778 --> 01:41:07,088
You can double click to open a

3183
01:41:07,088 --> 01:41:09,148
document and put it away.

3184
01:41:09,148 --> 01:41:10,908
And they stay organized.

3185
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:12,738
So for instance, if I bring

3186
01:41:12,798 --> 01:41:14,768
forward mail, maybe I drag an

3187
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:16,088
image out, I want you to watch

3188
01:41:16,088 --> 01:41:17,608
what happens because the image

3189
01:41:17,668 --> 01:41:19,618
flies right into the right

3190
01:41:19,788 --> 01:41:20,128
stack.

3191
01:41:20,868 --> 01:41:22,818
Now you can also scrub your

3192
01:41:22,818 --> 01:41:23,438
stacks.

3193
01:41:23,818 --> 01:41:24,858
So, for instance, I'll just

3194
01:41:24,998 --> 01:41:26,618
scrub across this stack.

3195
01:41:27,878 --> 01:41:29,718
You see I can select between

3196
01:41:29,718 --> 01:41:32,718
different photos, pick one up.

3197
01:41:32,788 --> 01:41:34,038
Actually let me just hide mail

3198
01:41:34,038 --> 01:41:35,378
here mid drag.

3199
01:41:35,578 --> 01:41:36,998
I got a little excited with my,

3200
01:41:38,528 --> 01:41:40,078
with all of my stack action.

3201
01:41:41,718 --> 01:41:45,838
So I can just drag this out and

3202
01:41:45,838 --> 01:41:47,808
drop it in just like that.

3203
01:41:47,808 --> 01:41:49,688
And that's a quick look at

3204
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:50,488
Stacks.

3205
01:41:50,558 --> 01:41:50,625
Now--

3206
01:41:51,528 --> 01:41:54,978
[ Applause ]

3207
01:41:55,478 --> 01:41:56,978
We've also brought some great

3208
01:41:57,038 --> 01:41:59,088
new changes to the finder.

3209
01:41:59,448 --> 01:42:00,958
I'd like to show them to you

3210
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:01,318
now.

3211
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:05,758
Now it starts with a new view.

3212
01:42:06,278 --> 01:42:09,408
We all enjoy using icon view,

3213
01:42:10,428 --> 01:42:11,298
list view.

3214
01:42:11,408 --> 01:42:13,388
There's of course column view,

3215
01:42:13,388 --> 01:42:15,728
but now we've added an all-new

3216
01:42:15,728 --> 01:42:17,698
view called gallery view.

3217
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:20,578
It has a big preview up top, a

3218
01:42:20,578 --> 01:42:21,858
set of thumbnails along the

3219
01:42:21,858 --> 01:42:23,668
bottom, and it makes it easy to

3220
01:42:23,668 --> 01:42:26,538
preview images, video,

3221
01:42:26,948 --> 01:42:29,498
presentations, documents,

3222
01:42:30,048 --> 01:42:33,318
spreadsheets, PDFs, and of

3223
01:42:33,318 --> 01:42:35,608
course with images sometimes you

3224
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:37,098
want to know more detail about,

3225
01:42:37,098 --> 01:42:37,948
for instance, how they were

3226
01:42:37,948 --> 01:42:39,348
captured, and now the new

3227
01:42:39,348 --> 01:42:41,798
sidebar in Mojave really helps

3228
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:44,768
because it now supports full

3229
01:42:44,768 --> 01:42:47,068
metadata, so you can see around

3230
01:42:47,068 --> 01:42:49,388
your photo, the camera you took

3231
01:42:49,388 --> 01:42:51,788
the photo on, the kind of lens,

3232
01:42:52,038 --> 01:42:53,848
the aperture settings, and so

3233
01:42:53,848 --> 01:42:54,188
forth.

3234
01:42:54,508 --> 01:42:55,498
It's really handy.

3235
01:42:55,498 --> 01:42:57,898
And you'll notice also along the

3236
01:42:57,958 --> 01:42:59,228
bottom there's this new area

3237
01:42:59,228 --> 01:43:01,598
called Quick Actions, and Quick

3238
01:43:01,598 --> 01:43:03,078
Actions that you act on the

3239
01:43:01,598 --> 01:43:03,078
Actions that you act on the

3240
01:43:03,078 --> 01:43:04,138
current photo.

3241
01:43:04,368 --> 01:43:05,598
So, for instance, if I have a

3242
01:43:05,598 --> 01:43:07,338
photo like this and I want to

3243
01:43:07,338 --> 01:43:09,038
edit it, I don't have to open it

3244
01:43:09,038 --> 01:43:09,968
and go through a new app.

3245
01:43:10,498 --> 01:43:12,488
I can rotate it right here

3246
01:43:12,488 --> 01:43:14,458
inside the finder.

3247
01:43:14,718 --> 01:43:16,088
It's really powerful.

3248
01:43:16,278 --> 01:43:17,798
Now this sidebar is available in

3249
01:43:17,798 --> 01:43:18,928
other views of the finder.

3250
01:43:19,348 --> 01:43:20,498
So for instance, I'm just going

3251
01:43:20,498 --> 01:43:21,758
to bring up the preview pane

3252
01:43:21,758 --> 01:43:23,118
here, and I'm going to do a

3253
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:27,148
multi selection of a PDF as well

3254
01:43:27,148 --> 01:43:29,128
as several images, and you'll

3255
01:43:29,128 --> 01:43:30,378
notice that the quick actions

3256
01:43:30,378 --> 01:43:32,578
area is contextual, so it shows

3257
01:43:32,578 --> 01:43:34,728
me create PDF as an option.

3258
01:43:35,138 --> 01:43:36,418
I'm going to click create PDF,

3259
01:43:36,418 --> 01:43:38,188
and it's going to assemble all

3260
01:43:38,188 --> 01:43:40,268
of these photos into a PDF just

3261
01:43:40,268 --> 01:43:41,418
like that.

3262
01:43:41,418 --> 01:43:43,318
But what's really great is these

3263
01:43:43,318 --> 01:43:45,508
actions are also customizable,

3264
01:43:45,948 --> 01:43:47,408
so you can create automator

3265
01:43:47,408 --> 01:43:49,458
actions and assign them to

3266
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:52,048
buttons here inside of Finder.

3267
01:43:52,558 --> 01:43:53,628
So you'll notice that now that I

3268
01:43:53,628 --> 01:43:55,608
have this PDF selected, I have

3269
01:43:55,608 --> 01:43:57,438
an option to run a custom

3270
01:43:57,438 --> 01:43:58,588
automator action that I've

3271
01:43:58,588 --> 01:44:00,538
created called Watermark PDF.

3272
01:44:01,538 --> 01:44:03,268
When I click it, my custom

3273
01:44:01,538 --> 01:44:03,268
When I click it, my custom

3274
01:44:03,268 --> 01:44:06,298
action runs, and my document is

3275
01:44:06,298 --> 01:44:08,958
watermarked, just like that.

3276
01:44:08,958 --> 01:44:10,448
And those are some quick

3277
01:44:10,448 --> 01:44:12,678
enhancements to the finder.

3278
01:44:14,528 --> 01:44:18,008
[ Applause ]

3279
01:44:18,508 --> 01:44:20,268
Now a tool that I think many of

3280
01:44:20,268 --> 01:44:22,038
us love when working with files

3281
01:44:22,278 --> 01:44:23,638
is Quick Look, and now in

3282
01:44:23,638 --> 01:44:25,628
Mojave, we made Quick Look more

3283
01:44:25,708 --> 01:44:27,538
powerful than ever by

3284
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:29,208
integrating Markup.

3285
01:44:29,208 --> 01:44:30,318
Let me show you how it works.

3286
01:44:31,238 --> 01:44:34,298
So you see down here I have a

3287
01:44:34,298 --> 01:44:36,198
permission slip and it's a PDF

3288
01:44:36,198 --> 01:44:36,778
document.

3289
01:44:36,778 --> 01:44:38,048
I'm just going to hit tap

3290
01:44:38,048 --> 01:44:40,318
spacebar to Quick Look it, and

3291
01:44:40,318 --> 01:44:42,218
you notice now I have the option

3292
01:44:42,348 --> 01:44:44,808
to invoke Markup.

3293
01:44:44,808 --> 01:44:47,468
I click, and now I have access

3294
01:44:47,468 --> 01:44:49,988
to my markup tools, including my

3295
01:44:49,988 --> 01:44:51,628
ability to sign this document.

3296
01:44:51,838 --> 01:44:54,068
I can just drag out my signature

3297
01:44:54,068 --> 01:44:57,078
like this, and I'm done.

3298
01:44:57,578 --> 01:44:59,928
Now this works for all kinds of

3299
01:44:59,978 --> 01:45:00,518
files.

3300
01:45:00,808 --> 01:45:02,848
So, for instance, with images I

3301
01:45:00,808 --> 01:45:02,848
So, for instance, with images I

3302
01:45:02,848 --> 01:45:06,168
can rotate and crop, and with

3303
01:45:06,168 --> 01:45:09,688
video I can even trim right here

3304
01:45:10,148 --> 01:45:11,518
inside of Quick Look.

3305
01:45:11,578 --> 01:45:13,888
And that's a quick look at Quick

3306
01:45:13,888 --> 01:45:13,988
Look.

3307
01:45:14,528 --> 01:45:18,898
[ Applause ]

3308
01:45:19,398 --> 01:45:20,438
Next, I want to talk about how

3309
01:45:20,438 --> 01:45:22,028
we capture content on our Mac

3310
01:45:22,098 --> 01:45:23,148
because one of the tools I think

3311
01:45:23,268 --> 01:45:24,988
many of us use all the time is

3312
01:45:24,988 --> 01:45:26,748
Screenshots, and we've made

3313
01:45:26,748 --> 01:45:28,668
Screenshots more powerful than

3314
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:29,898
ever in Mohave.

3315
01:45:31,128 --> 01:45:34,648
So let's take a look here at a

3316
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,518
webpage, and I'm just going to

3317
01:45:36,658 --> 01:45:37,738
take a screenshot in the

3318
01:45:37,738 --> 01:45:38,448
traditional way.

3319
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:39,458
I'm going to screen shot a

3320
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:42,228
selection of the page, and I

3321
01:45:42,228 --> 01:45:43,278
want you to watch what happens

3322
01:45:43,278 --> 01:45:44,018
in the lower right.

3323
01:45:44,018 --> 01:45:46,908
I get a thumbnail instantly of

3324
01:45:46,908 --> 01:45:48,588
that screenshot, and when I

3325
01:45:48,588 --> 01:45:49,668
double click in, I get an

3326
01:45:49,668 --> 01:45:51,998
accelerated workflow right into

3327
01:45:51,998 --> 01:45:53,468
Markup where I have access to

3328
01:45:53,468 --> 01:45:54,548
all of my tools.

3329
01:45:55,108 --> 01:45:56,438
So, for instance, if I want to

3330
01:45:56,438 --> 01:45:59,048
create a magnification here, I

3331
01:45:59,048 --> 01:46:03,258
can just drag that out.

3332
01:45:59,048 --> 01:46:03,258
can just drag that out.

3333
01:46:03,518 --> 01:46:06,478
Magnify. It's that easy.

3334
01:46:06,788 --> 01:46:08,218
But now we've also made it

3335
01:46:08,218 --> 01:46:10,078
easier to access a variety of

3336
01:46:10,078 --> 01:46:11,998
tools, so when I bring up my

3337
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:14,118
screenshotting, you see I'm

3338
01:46:14,118 --> 01:46:15,978
presented with this hud that

3339
01:46:15,978 --> 01:46:17,208
tells me I can capture the

3340
01:46:17,208 --> 01:46:19,918
entire screen, a selected window

3341
01:46:19,918 --> 01:46:21,898
or selection, but we've also

3342
01:46:21,898 --> 01:46:24,348
added screen capture for video

3343
01:46:24,818 --> 01:46:26,658
right into screenshotting.

3344
01:46:26,868 --> 01:46:28,278
Let me show you how that works.

3345
01:46:28,278 --> 01:46:29,948
So I'm going to go to a webpage

3346
01:46:29,948 --> 01:46:31,468
here that has an animation

3347
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:31,758
running.

3348
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:33,488
I'm going to bring up my

3349
01:46:33,488 --> 01:46:35,508
screenshotting tools, and say

3350
01:46:35,698 --> 01:46:38,028
record the selected area.

3351
01:46:38,508 --> 01:46:39,948
I'll just make a nice selection

3352
01:46:39,948 --> 01:46:40,168
here.

3353
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:42,798
Okay. And I'm recording just

3354
01:46:42,798 --> 01:46:43,848
like that.

3355
01:46:43,848 --> 01:46:45,038
Of course I can manipulate the

3356
01:46:45,038 --> 01:46:47,388
app, so all will be reflected in

3357
01:46:47,388 --> 01:46:50,428
my recording, and when I'm done,

3358
01:46:50,428 --> 01:46:51,558
I can click the stop button

3359
01:46:51,558 --> 01:46:52,478
right up here.

3360
01:46:52,878 --> 01:46:53,738
And now you notice I have this

3361
01:46:53,818 --> 01:46:55,018
thumbnail in the lower right.

3362
01:46:55,018 --> 01:46:57,718
Well I can actually pick this up

3363
01:46:57,868 --> 01:46:59,668
and drag it into a new space and

3364
01:46:59,868 --> 01:47:01,878
incorporate it right into a

3365
01:47:01,878 --> 01:47:03,878
document, just like that.

3366
01:47:01,878 --> 01:47:03,878
document, just like that.

3367
01:47:04,688 --> 01:47:06,278
Now, we've further enhanced the

3368
01:47:06,278 --> 01:47:08,348
way you capture content, and

3369
01:47:08,458 --> 01:47:10,768
that brings me to Continuity.

3370
01:47:11,138 --> 01:47:13,098
So Mac users love Continuity for

3371
01:47:13,098 --> 01:47:14,448
the way it lets us work across

3372
01:47:14,448 --> 01:47:17,318
our devices with things like Air

3373
01:47:17,318 --> 01:47:18,878
Drop or the ability to unlock

3374
01:47:18,938 --> 01:47:21,158
your Mac using your Apple Watch.

3375
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,888
When it comes to capturing

3376
01:47:22,888 --> 01:47:24,848
content, we'll walk around with

3377
01:47:24,848 --> 01:47:26,218
one of the best content capture

3378
01:47:26,218 --> 01:47:27,468
devices in the world in our

3379
01:47:27,468 --> 01:47:29,068
pockets, our phones.

3380
01:47:29,678 --> 01:47:31,138
And so we wanted to take

3381
01:47:31,138 --> 01:47:32,818
advantage of continuity to bring

3382
01:47:32,818 --> 01:47:34,138
that to the Mac with a feature

3383
01:47:34,138 --> 01:47:36,228
we call Continuity Camera.

3384
01:47:36,228 --> 01:47:38,188
Let me show you how it works.

3385
01:47:39,768 --> 01:47:41,288
So here in my Keynote

3386
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:43,438
presentation, I have a space

3387
01:47:43,438 --> 01:47:44,908
that's just waiting for a new

3388
01:47:44,988 --> 01:47:46,778
photo, and on my phone right

3389
01:47:46,858 --> 01:47:47,178
here.

3390
01:47:48,318 --> 01:47:49,858
Well, when I select this object,

3391
01:47:49,948 --> 01:47:52,678
I can choose to take a photo.

3392
01:47:52,678 --> 01:47:53,818
And I want you to watch what

3393
01:47:53,818 --> 01:47:55,038
happens when I select this to my

3394
01:47:55,108 --> 01:47:55,778
phone.

3395
01:47:56,078 --> 01:47:58,088
It automatically immediately

3396
01:47:58,088 --> 01:48:01,628
lights up ready to take a photo.

3397
01:48:01,728 --> 01:48:05,818
So I can take one like this, and

3398
01:48:01,728 --> 01:48:05,818
So I can take one like this, and

3399
01:48:05,818 --> 01:48:08,738
when I do, I can select use

3400
01:48:08,808 --> 01:48:10,748
photo, and it apps directly in

3401
01:48:10,748 --> 01:48:11,458
my document.

3402
01:48:11,458 --> 01:48:11,978
Isn't that cool?

3403
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:16,748
[ Applause ]

3404
01:48:17,248 --> 01:48:18,308
Now, this works as well for

3405
01:48:18,308 --> 01:48:19,528
scanning documents.

3406
01:48:20,178 --> 01:48:21,508
So here I have a place where I

3407
01:48:21,508 --> 01:48:22,668
could use a scan.

3408
01:48:23,388 --> 01:48:25,248
Once again, I'm going to select

3409
01:48:26,028 --> 01:48:27,968
from the menu and this time scan

3410
01:48:27,968 --> 01:48:28,478
document.

3411
01:48:28,758 --> 01:48:30,688
Again, my camera lights up, this

3412
01:48:30,688 --> 01:48:31,898
time right in my document

3413
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:32,338
scanner.

3414
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:34,258
I just scan like this.

3415
01:48:34,258 --> 01:48:36,558
I can save it.

3416
01:48:37,628 --> 01:48:39,608
And my scan goes immediately,

3417
01:48:39,608 --> 01:48:41,968
and I think I forgot to push the

3418
01:48:41,968 --> 01:48:42,528
save button.

3419
01:48:42,528 --> 01:48:43,568
Sorry about that everybody.

3420
01:48:44,058 --> 01:48:44,858
There you go, appears

3421
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:46,188
immediately in my document.

3422
01:48:46,868 --> 01:48:47,338
Thank you.

3423
01:48:50,628 --> 01:48:51,898
[applause] And so just like that

3424
01:48:52,538 --> 01:48:55,508
I can take photos, stills, and

3425
01:48:55,598 --> 01:48:57,988
even capture video, and this is

3426
01:48:57,988 --> 01:48:59,498
a quick look at some great new

3427
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:00,948
features in Mojave.

3428
01:49:01,528 --> 01:49:06,888
[ Applause ]

3429
01:49:01,528 --> 01:49:06,888
[ Applause ]

3430
01:49:07,388 --> 01:49:11,658
Next, I'd like to turn to apps.

3431
01:49:11,898 --> 01:49:13,988
We are bringing News to the Mac.

3432
01:49:14,528 --> 01:49:17,558
[ Applause ]

3433
01:49:18,058 --> 01:49:19,628
Now News has all of the stories

3434
01:49:19,628 --> 01:49:21,278
you've come to expect from News

3435
01:49:21,368 --> 01:49:23,618
on iOS, and it looks amazing on

3436
01:49:23,618 --> 01:49:24,528
the Mac display.

3437
01:49:25,038 --> 01:49:27,128
You get top stories picked by

3438
01:49:27,128 --> 01:49:30,028
our editors, trending stories,

3439
01:49:30,608 --> 01:49:32,638
you're personalized for you and

3440
01:49:32,638 --> 01:49:36,968
that's not for me, and you also

3441
01:49:36,968 --> 01:49:38,888
get this great new sidebar where

3442
01:49:38,888 --> 01:49:40,798
you can drill in and jump right

3443
01:49:40,798 --> 01:49:42,438
to the topics and channels you

3444
01:49:42,538 --> 01:49:43,158
follow.

3445
01:49:43,268 --> 01:49:44,558
News is going to be great.

3446
01:49:45,018 --> 01:49:47,338
We also have Stocks coming to

3447
01:49:47,338 --> 01:49:47,678
the Mac.

3448
01:49:48,468 --> 01:49:50,108
Now you get your stock prices

3449
01:49:50,108 --> 01:49:51,538
combined with high-quality

3450
01:49:51,628 --> 01:49:53,608
business news delivered from

3451
01:49:53,608 --> 01:49:54,338
Apple News.

3452
01:49:54,868 --> 01:49:56,258
It shows you your watch list

3453
01:49:56,258 --> 01:49:57,918
with your prices on the left,

3454
01:49:57,918 --> 01:49:59,728
and you can drill in to this

3455
01:49:59,728 --> 01:50:01,758
interactive chart to get more

3456
01:50:01,758 --> 01:50:03,348
information and, of course,

3457
01:50:01,758 --> 01:50:03,348
information and, of course,

3458
01:50:04,098 --> 01:50:05,018
great news.

3459
01:50:05,858 --> 01:50:08,308
We're also bringing Voice Memos

3460
01:50:08,368 --> 01:50:08,758
to the Mac.

3461
01:50:09,068 --> 01:50:10,678
Now Voice Memos is the most

3462
01:50:10,798 --> 01:50:13,778
popular voice recorder on iOS,

3463
01:50:13,878 --> 01:50:16,078
and so many of us use it to

3464
01:50:16,178 --> 01:50:18,078
capture music recordings or

3465
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,978
lectures, and now that Voice

3466
01:50:19,978 --> 01:50:22,498
Memos syncs via iCloud to your

3467
01:50:23,038 --> 01:50:23,928
Mac, you can take those

3468
01:50:23,928 --> 01:50:25,468
recordings that you make and for

3469
01:50:25,468 --> 01:50:26,998
instance drag them right into

3470
01:50:26,998 --> 01:50:28,778
Garage Band as the foundation

3471
01:50:28,828 --> 01:50:29,388
for a song.

3472
01:50:30,248 --> 01:50:32,498
Finally, thrilled to announce

3473
01:50:32,688 --> 01:50:34,538
Home is coming to the Mac as

3474
01:50:34,538 --> 01:50:34,948
well.

3475
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:39,938
[ Applause ]

3476
01:50:40,438 --> 01:50:41,858
You have all of your accessories

3477
01:50:41,938 --> 01:50:42,428
here.

3478
01:50:42,428 --> 01:50:45,348
You can run your scenes as well

3479
01:50:45,348 --> 01:50:47,408
as monitor your video cameras,

3480
01:50:47,688 --> 01:50:49,868
and of course with Siri you can

3481
01:50:49,868 --> 01:50:51,498
command your home with your

3482
01:50:51,498 --> 01:50:51,848
voice.

3483
01:50:52,418 --> 01:50:55,048
So those are four great new apps

3484
01:50:55,478 --> 01:50:56,868
coming to Mojave.

3485
01:50:58,528 --> 01:51:01,698
[ Applause ]

3486
01:51:02,198 --> 01:51:03,878
Next, I'd like to talk about

3487
01:51:03,878 --> 01:51:05,598
security and privacy.

3488
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:07,838
You know, one of the reasons

3489
01:51:07,998 --> 01:51:09,338
that people choose Apple

3490
01:51:09,338 --> 01:51:10,788
products is because of our

3491
01:51:10,788 --> 01:51:12,638
commitment to security and

3492
01:51:12,638 --> 01:51:13,208
privacy.

3493
01:51:13,998 --> 01:51:16,268
And we believe that your private

3494
01:51:16,328 --> 01:51:18,668
data should remain private, not

3495
01:51:18,768 --> 01:51:20,178
because you've done something

3496
01:51:20,178 --> 01:51:21,368
wrong or that you have something

3497
01:51:21,368 --> 01:51:23,088
to hide but because there can be

3498
01:51:23,088 --> 01:51:24,958
a lot of sensitive data on your

3499
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:26,938
devices, and we think you should

3500
01:51:26,938 --> 01:51:28,668
be in control of who sees it.

3501
01:51:29,558 --> 01:51:31,558
Now, to begin we protect your

3502
01:51:31,558 --> 01:51:33,408
information on your devices

3503
01:51:34,088 --> 01:51:36,318
using state of the art hardware

3504
01:51:36,318 --> 01:51:38,498
and software, and this year

3505
01:51:38,498 --> 01:51:40,158
we're adding greater protections

3506
01:51:40,568 --> 01:51:42,318
about how apps can access that

3507
01:51:42,318 --> 01:51:42,928
information.

3508
01:51:44,018 --> 01:51:46,178
Today, Apple devices check in

3509
01:51:46,178 --> 01:51:47,748
with you before granting an app

3510
01:51:47,748 --> 01:51:49,728
access to information like your

3511
01:51:49,728 --> 01:51:50,438
location.

3512
01:51:51,008 --> 01:51:52,168
You could tell because you'll

3513
01:51:52,168 --> 01:51:53,478
see an alert just like this one,

3514
01:51:54,068 --> 01:51:56,118
and macOS already provides

3515
01:51:56,118 --> 01:51:58,598
API-level protections for things

3516
01:51:58,598 --> 01:52:01,228
like contacts, photos, calendar,

3517
01:52:01,228 --> 01:52:02,828
and reminders, but now in

3518
01:52:01,228 --> 01:52:02,828
and reminders, but now in

3519
01:52:02,828 --> 01:52:04,908
Mojave, we're extending these

3520
01:52:04,908 --> 01:52:07,038
protections to include your

3521
01:52:07,038 --> 01:52:09,868
camera and your microphone as

3522
01:52:09,868 --> 01:52:11,198
well as protecting sensitive

3523
01:52:11,198 --> 01:52:12,798
parts of your file system, like

3524
01:52:12,798 --> 01:52:14,548
your mail database, your message

3525
01:52:14,548 --> 01:52:16,438
history, and your backups.

3526
01:52:16,928 --> 01:52:18,798
And all of this is protected by

3527
01:52:18,798 --> 01:52:21,248
default for any app that you run

3528
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,238
on the system, an important

3529
01:52:22,378 --> 01:52:22,938
protection.

3530

[ Applause ]

3531
01:52:29,128 --> 01:52:30,118
Next, I want to turn to some

3532
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:32,018
great enhancements to Safari.

3533
01:52:32,418 --> 01:52:33,768
Safari works really hard to

3534
01:52:34,308 --> 01:52:35,868
protect your privacy, and this

3535
01:52:35,868 --> 01:52:37,748
year it's working even harder.

3536
01:52:38,128 --> 01:52:39,868
Last year, we introduced

3537
01:52:39,868 --> 01:52:41,568
intelligent tracking prevention

3538
01:52:41,928 --> 01:52:43,558
to dramatically reduce the

3539
01:52:43,558 --> 01:52:45,468
ability for apps to track you

3540
01:52:45,468 --> 01:52:47,498

This is the kind of thing where

3542
01:52:49,578 --> 01:52:50,958
you look at a product on one

3543

site.

3544
01:52:51,668 --> 01:52:53,118
Then you move to another site

3545
01:52:53,388 --> 01:52:55,108
and another site and somehow

3546
01:52:55,108 --> 01:52:56,168
this is just following you

3547
01:52:56,168 --> 01:52:57,298
wherever you go.

3548
01:52:58,218 --> 01:53:00,128

fields.

3553
01:53:05,908 --> 01:53:07,888
Well, it turns out these can be

3554
01:53:07,888 --> 01:53:09,828
used to track you, whether you

3555
01:53:09,828 --> 01:53:12,528
click on them or not, and so

3556
01:53:12,528 --> 01:53:14,428
this year we are shutting that

3557
01:53:14,508 --> 01:53:14,988
down.

[ Applause ]

3559
01:53:24,068 --> 01:53:25,038
Now if you do want to interact

3560
01:53:25,038 --> 01:53:25,978
with one of these or one of

3561
01:53:25,978 --> 01:53:27,538
these apps tries to access that

3562
01:53:27,538 --> 01:53:30,198
information, you'll get this,

3563
01:53:30,198 --> 01:53:32,428
and you can decide to keep your

3564
01:53:32,428 --> 01:53:33,438
information private.

3565
01:53:34,398 --> 01:53:39,128
Now next let's talk about

3566
01:53:39,228 --> 01:53:39,908
Fingerprinting.

3567
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:42,788
You know, data companies are

3568
01:53:42,788 --> 01:53:45,118
clever and relentless, and in

3569
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:47,948
addition to cookies, they use

3570
01:53:47,948 --> 01:53:49,028
another method called

3571
01:53:49,028 --> 01:53:49,888
Fingerprinting.

3572
01:53:50,258 --> 01:53:51,348
And here's how it works.

3573
01:53:51,868 --> 01:53:53,358
Just like you can be identified

3574
01:53:53,358 --> 01:53:55,528
by a fingerprint, it turns out

3575
01:53:55,528 --> 01:53:57,468
that when you browse the web,

3576
01:53:57,828 --> 01:53:59,488
you're device can be identify by

3577
01:53:59,488 --> 01:54:01,528
a unique set of characteristics,

3578
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:04,288
like its configuration, its

3579
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:04,288
like its configuration, its

3580
01:54:04,428 --> 01:54:06,078
fonts that you have installed

3581
01:54:06,078 --> 01:54:07,698
and the plug-insulin that you

3582
01:54:07,698 --> 01:54:08,698
might have on the device.

3583
01:54:08,698 --> 01:54:10,678
And these data companies can use

3584
01:54:10,678 --> 01:54:12,148
the set of characteristics to

3585
01:54:12,148 --> 01:54:13,748
construct a unique fingerprint

3586
01:54:14,358 --> 01:54:16,278
to track your device from site

3587
01:54:16,518 --> 01:54:16,988
to site.

3588
01:54:18,678 --> 01:54:19,908
With Mojave, we're making it

3589
01:54:19,908 --> 01:54:22,188
much harder for trackers to

3590
01:54:22,228 --> 01:54:23,288
create a unique fingerprint.

3591
01:54:24,018 --> 01:54:25,318
We're presenting webpages with

3592
01:54:25,318 --> 01:54:26,828
only a simplified system

3593
01:54:26,828 --> 01:54:27,618
configuration.

3594
01:54:28,498 --> 01:54:29,818
We show them only built-in

3595
01:54:29,888 --> 01:54:32,438
fonts, and Legacy plug-insulin

3596
01:54:32,438 --> 01:54:33,438
are no longer supported, so

3597
01:54:33,438 --> 01:54:34,708
those can't contribute to a

3598
01:54:34,788 --> 01:54:36,748
fingerprint, and as a result,

3599
01:54:36,748 --> 01:54:38,678
your Mac will look more like

3600
01:54:38,678 --> 01:54:40,298
everyone else's Mac, and it will

3601
01:54:40,298 --> 01:54:41,948
be dramatically more difficult

3602
01:54:41,948 --> 01:54:43,308
for data companies to uniquely

3603
01:54:43,308 --> 01:54:44,818
identify your device and track

3604
01:54:44,818 --> 01:54:44,885

01:58:17,008 --> 01:58:19,458
time, an apps rank if it's

3710
01:58:19,458 --> 01:58:20,758
charting and if it's been named

3711
01:58:20,758 --> 01:58:21,528
editor's choice.

3712
01:58:22,198 --> 01:58:24,918
Ratings and reviews are now

3713
01:58:25,088 --> 01:58:27,118
front and center, and these are

3714
01:58:27,248 --> 01:58:28,878
so important for app discovery.

3715
01:58:29,338 --> 01:58:31,208
So we're introducing a ratings

3716
01:58:31,208 --> 01:58:33,118
and review API for Mac apps.

3717
01:58:34,048 --> 01:58:35,938
Now, it'll be easier than ever

3718
01:58:35,938 --> 01:58:37,378
for people to leave feedback.

3719
01:58:38,868 --> 01:58:40,448
We're really excited about the

3720
01:58:40,448 --> 01:58:41,908
all-new Mac App Store.

3721
01:58:42,218 --> 01:58:43,518
We've talked to some developers

3722
01:58:43,518 --> 01:58:44,868
already, and they're really

3723
01:58:44,868 --> 01:58:45,678
excited too.

3724
01:58:46,288 --> 01:58:48,398
Like Microsoft, who will bring

3725
01:58:48,398 --> 01:58:50,868
Office 365 to the Mac App Store

3726
01:58:50,868 --> 01:58:51,888
later this year.

3727
01:58:52,528 --> 01:58:55,578
[ Applause ]

3728
01:58:56,078 --> 01:58:57,968
And Adobe is bringing Lightroom

3729
01:58:57,968 --> 01:58:58,748
CC.

3730
01:58:59,718 --> 01:59:01,898
Panic is bringing Transmit.

3731
01:59:01,898 --> 01:59:05,518
And Bare Bones is bringing BB

3732
01:59:01,898 --> 01:59:05,518
And Bare Bones is bringing BB

3733
01:59:05,518 --> 01:59:05,918
Edit.

3734
01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:09,338
[applause] And many more great

3735
01:59:09,398 --> 01:59:11,108
names are coming to the all-new

3736
01:59:11,108 --> 01:59:12,358
Mac App Store too.

3737
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:14,458
We can't wait for you to check

3738
01:59:14,458 --> 01:59:15,828
out the new Mac App Store.

3739
01:59:16,238 --> 01:59:18,188
Now, I'll hand it back to Craig.

3740
01:59:19,528 --> 01:59:25,018
[ Applause ]

3741
01:59:25,518 --> 01:59:27,078
So we think the Mac App Store is

3742
01:59:27,078 --> 01:59:28,618
going to inspire whole-new

3743
01:59:28,618 --> 01:59:30,608
generations of apps, and so we

3744
01:59:30,608 --> 01:59:31,968
want to talk about some of the

3745
01:59:31,968 --> 01:59:34,428
technologies that will be behind

3746
01:59:34,758 --> 01:59:36,438
some of that next generation.

3747
01:59:36,838 --> 01:59:38,738
We spoke earlier about ARKit.

3748
01:59:38,828 --> 01:59:40,918
I want to talk about two more.

3749
01:59:41,728 --> 01:59:43,538
And let's start with Metal.

3750
01:59:44,398 --> 01:59:46,028
Now Metal is the technology to

3751
01:59:46,028 --> 01:59:47,428
get the highest performance

3752
01:59:47,458 --> 01:59:49,668
graphics and computation from

3753
01:59:49,668 --> 01:59:50,878
graphics processors.

3754
01:59:51,318 --> 01:59:52,778
Metal was designed for modern

3755
01:59:52,998 --> 01:59:53,228
GPUs.

3756
01:59:53,228 --> 01:59:56,278
It's incredibly efficient, and

3757
01:59:56,278 --> 01:59:57,358
that enables amazing

3758
01:59:57,358 --> 01:59:58,948
console-level games like

3759
01:59:59,088 --> 02:00:01,568
Fortnight from Epic to run great

3760
02:00:01,568 --> 02:00:03,788
for the first time on mobile.

3761
02:00:01,568 --> 02:00:03,788
for the first time on mobile.

3762
02:00:04,678 --> 02:00:06,298
But Metal also enables these

3763
02:00:06,298 --> 02:00:08,768
games to scale to take full

3764
02:00:08,768 --> 02:00:10,738
advantage of modern Macs.

3765
02:00:11,398 --> 02:00:13,408
In fact, across iOS and the Mac,

3766
02:00:13,558 --> 02:00:15,358
there are over one billion

3767
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:18,618
Metal-enabled devices, and we're

3768
02:00:18,618 --> 02:00:20,208
constantly making Metal better.

3769
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:22,818
To bring the highest GPU

3770
02:00:22,818 --> 02:00:24,388
performance in reach of all

3771
02:00:24,938 --> 02:00:26,098
Macs, we've recently added

3772
02:00:26,098 --> 02:00:29,168
support for external GPUs, and

3773
02:00:30,698 --> 02:00:32,428
this is powered by Metal, and

3774
02:00:32,428 --> 02:00:33,908
the results are truly mind

3775
02:00:33,908 --> 02:00:34,408
boggling.

3776
02:00:34,898 --> 02:00:37,128
For instance, running a filter

3777
02:00:37,128 --> 02:00:38,828
in DaVinci Resolve, look at how

3778
02:00:38,828 --> 02:00:40,908
it scales on the incredibly fast

3779
02:00:40,908 --> 02:00:43,808
iMac Pro as you add up to four

3780
02:00:43,808 --> 02:00:44,338
eGPUs.

3781
02:00:44,338 --> 02:00:47,068
Now, the results are even more

3782
02:00:47,068 --> 02:00:48,268
staggering when you take a

3783
02:00:48,368 --> 02:00:50,498
13-inch MacBook Pro and add

3784
02:00:50,498 --> 02:00:53,818
eGPUs to it, achieving up to 8.5

3785
02:00:53,818 --> 02:00:55,218
times speedup.

3786
02:00:55,218 --> 02:00:56,068
It's pretty awesome.

3787
02:00:57,388 --> 02:00:59,618
Now, eGPUs also enable Macs to

3788
02:00:59,618 --> 02:01:00,968
achieve all-new levels of

3789
02:01:00,968 --> 02:01:02,898
performance and realism in 3D

3790
02:01:00,968 --> 02:01:02,898
performance and realism in 3D

3791
02:01:02,898 --> 02:01:04,398
rendering and gaming.

3792
02:01:04,858 --> 02:01:06,288
Now this beautiful forest you

3793
02:01:06,288 --> 02:01:08,118
see here, this isn't a video

3794
02:01:08,118 --> 02:01:08,698
capture.

3795
02:01:09,358 --> 02:01:11,688
This is from Unity's new Book of

3796
02:01:11,688 --> 02:01:13,618
the Dead interactive demo, and

3797
02:01:13,618 --> 02:01:15,828
it's being rendered live right

3798
02:01:15,878 --> 02:01:18,968
now on a MacBook with an eGPU

3799
02:01:18,968 --> 02:01:20,558
powering this display.

3800
02:01:20,658 --> 02:01:21,808
I mean doesn't this look

3801
02:01:21,808 --> 02:01:21,988
amazing?

3802
02:01:22,528 --> 02:01:27,218
[ Applause ]

3803
02:01:27,718 --> 02:01:28,978
Now, of course because this is

3804
02:01:29,038 --> 02:01:30,998
rendered live, we can check

3805
02:01:31,028 --> 02:01:32,448
what's up ahead, so let's start

3806
02:01:32,448 --> 02:01:32,808
walking.

3807
02:01:34,218 --> 02:01:35,738
Now Unity is using Metal's

3808
02:01:35,968 --> 02:01:38,598
unified graphics and compute to

3809
02:01:38,658 --> 02:01:41,088
generate real-time lighting and

3810
02:01:41,118 --> 02:01:43,568
complex post-processing effects.

3811
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:48,708
So cool. And that's all rendered

3812
02:01:48,828 --> 02:01:51,108
live on a MacBook running with

3813
02:01:51,108 --> 02:01:52,108
an eGPU.

3814
02:01:52,108 --> 02:01:52,988
It's pretty great.

3815
02:01:53,528 --> 02:01:58,558
[ Applause ]

3816
02:01:59,058 --> 02:02:00,068
Now another place where we're

3817
02:02:00,068 --> 02:02:01,368
doing incredible acceleration

3818
02:02:01,368 --> 02:02:03,378
with Metal is in machine

3819
02:02:01,368 --> 02:02:03,378
with Metal is in machine

3820
02:02:03,378 --> 02:02:03,768
learning.

3821
02:02:04,248 --> 02:02:06,898
And today ML specialists usually

3822
02:02:06,898 --> 02:02:09,348
use one of these third-party

3823
02:02:09,348 --> 02:02:11,128
libraries to train their models

3824
02:02:11,218 --> 02:02:13,408
using servers, and now it turns

3825
02:02:13,408 --> 02:02:15,248
out we can accelerate tools like

3826
02:02:15,318 --> 02:02:16,488
this with our new Metal

3827
02:02:16,488 --> 02:02:17,878
performance shaders.

3828
02:02:18,048 --> 02:02:19,628
We're seeing speedups of up to

3829
02:02:19,628 --> 02:02:22,188
20 times and using the GPU with

3830
02:02:22,188 --> 02:02:23,618
Metal instead of CPU-based

3831
02:02:23,618 --> 02:02:24,178
training.

3832
02:02:24,508 --> 02:02:25,838
And while speeding these tools

3833
02:02:25,838 --> 02:02:27,458
up is great, we actually thing

3834
02:02:27,458 --> 02:02:28,928
there's a better way for most

3835
02:02:28,928 --> 02:02:31,238
developers, and that's training

3836
02:02:31,238 --> 02:02:33,158
on the Mac you already have

3837
02:02:33,508 --> 02:02:35,848
using a great new tool we call

3838
02:02:35,848 --> 02:02:36,738
Create ML.

[ Applause ]

3840
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,828
Now, Create ML is designed to

3841
02:02:43,918 --> 02:02:45,828
let you train without being a

3842
02:02:45,828 --> 02:02:47,138
machine learning expert.

3843
02:02:47,578 --> 02:02:49,478
You can train vision and natural

3844
02:02:49,508 --> 02:02:50,378
language models.

3845
02:02:50,378 --> 02:02:51,938
You can bring your own custom

3846
02:02:51,938 --> 02:02:53,198
data, and it's really easy to

3847
02:02:53,198 --> 02:02:54,838
use because it's all built in

3848
02:02:54,838 --> 02:02:55,958
Swift.

3849
02:02:55,958 --> 02:02:57,258
In fact, you can use Xcode

3850
02:02:57,338 --> 02:02:58,718
Playgrounds to train your model.

3851
02:02:58,758 --> 02:03:00,858
Just drag one in, you're

3852
02:03:00,858 --> 02:03:02,338
training set, you can drag in

3853
02:03:00,858 --> 02:03:02,338
training set, you can drag in

3854
02:03:02,338 --> 02:03:04,028
your test set as well, and the

3855
02:03:04,028 --> 02:03:05,858
training is all GPU accelerated,

3856
02:03:05,858 --> 02:03:07,698
so it's incredibly fast.

3857
02:03:08,328 --> 02:03:09,978
Now, as an example, we worked

3858
02:03:09,978 --> 02:03:11,088
with Memrise.

3859
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:12,858
They're a developer who uses the

3860
02:03:12,858 --> 02:03:15,048
camera to identify objects and

3861
02:03:15,048 --> 02:03:15,828
speak them in multiple

3862
02:03:15,828 --> 02:03:18,028
languages, and in the past, they

3863
02:03:18,028 --> 02:03:18,938
would train their model with

3864
02:03:18,938 --> 02:03:20,778
20,000 images, and it would take

3865
02:03:20,778 --> 02:03:23,778
them 24 hours to do so.

3866
02:03:23,878 --> 02:03:25,918
Well now with Create ML, they

3867
02:03:25,918 --> 02:03:29,278
can train that same model in 48

3868
02:03:29,278 --> 02:03:30,988
minutes on a MacBook Pro.

[ Applause ]

3870
02:03:36,578 --> 02:03:39,198
And on iMac Pro, it's just 18

3871
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:39,398
minutes.

3872
02:03:39,398 --> 02:03:41,458
And what's even more incredible

3873
02:03:41,458 --> 02:03:43,078
is that model in the past for

3874
02:03:43,078 --> 02:03:45,498
them was 90 megabytes, and now

3875
02:03:45,498 --> 02:03:47,078
it's just three megabytes.

3876
02:03:47,568 --> 02:03:48,958
It's a huge difference.

3877
02:03:50,528 --> 02:03:53,718
[ Applause ]

3878
02:03:54,218 --> 02:03:55,838
Now we also are making models

3879
02:03:55,978 --> 02:03:57,898
run much faster on device using

3880
02:03:57,898 --> 02:03:58,968
Core ML 2.

3881
02:03:58,968 --> 02:04:00,498
Now Core ML is our technology

3882
02:04:00,538 --> 02:04:02,198
for high performance on-device

3883
02:04:00,538 --> 02:04:02,198
for high performance on-device

3884
02:04:02,198 --> 02:04:03,858
machine learning, and now it's

3885
02:04:03,858 --> 02:04:04,688
better than ever.

3886
02:04:05,518 --> 02:04:07,118
It's 30 percent faster in

3887
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:08,688
on-device processing using a

3888
02:04:08,688 --> 02:04:09,738
technique called batch

3889
02:04:09,838 --> 02:04:11,868
predictions, and you can reduce

3890
02:04:11,868 --> 02:04:14,058
your model size by up to 75

3891
02:04:14,108 --> 02:04:16,068
percent using quantization.

3892
02:04:16,708 --> 02:04:20,028
And so that's Core ML and Create

3893
02:04:20,028 --> 02:04:20,288
ML.

3894
02:04:20,758 --> 02:04:21,838
You no longer have to be an

3895
02:04:21,838 --> 02:04:24,578
expert in machine learning to

3896
02:04:24,578 --> 02:04:25,988
build those techniques into your

3897
02:04:27,268 --> 02:04:27,358
app.

3898
02:04:27,628 --> 02:04:29,498
Now, these technologies are

3899
02:04:29,548 --> 02:04:31,018
redefining what's possible in

3900
02:04:31,088 --> 02:04:33,998
apps, and they're common not

3901
02:04:33,998 --> 02:04:36,058
just to macOS but also to iOS,

3902
02:04:36,058 --> 02:04:37,988
and the fact that the mac and

3903
02:04:38,078 --> 02:04:40,748
iOS share so much technology has

3904
02:04:41,098 --> 02:04:43,688
led people almost every year to

3905
02:04:43,718 --> 02:04:46,348
keep asking us the question, are

3906
02:04:46,348 --> 02:04:48,548
you merging iOS and macOS?

3907
02:04:49,748 --> 02:04:51,598
So I'd like to take a moment to

3908
02:04:51,738 --> 02:04:53,368
briefly address this question.

3909
02:04:54,188 --> 02:04:56,978
No. Of course not.

3910
02:04:57,528 --> 02:05:02,378
[ Applause ]

3911
02:04:57,528 --> 02:05:02,378
[ Applause ]

3912
02:05:02,878 --> 02:05:04,538
We love the Mac because it's,

3913
02:05:04,718 --> 02:05:06,218
and we love macOS because it's

3914
02:05:06,338 --> 02:05:10,018
explicitly created that a unique

3915
02:05:10,018 --> 02:05:12,208
characteristics of Mac hardware,

3916
02:05:12,208 --> 02:05:13,628
like the ergonomics of the

3917
02:05:13,708 --> 02:05:15,548
keyboard and the trackpad, the

3918
02:05:15,548 --> 02:05:17,498
flexibility in displays and

3919
02:05:17,498 --> 02:05:19,428
storage and because of the power

3920
02:05:19,428 --> 02:05:20,088
it exposes.

3921
02:05:20,088 --> 02:05:21,048
It makes the Mac able to

3922
02:05:21,048 --> 02:05:22,698
accomplish almost anything.

3923
02:05:23,268 --> 02:05:24,938
So we think that this question

3924
02:05:24,938 --> 02:05:26,138
is actually coming from

3925
02:05:26,198 --> 02:05:26,998
something else.

3926
02:05:28,068 --> 02:05:30,138
You know, Mac users have access

3927
02:05:30,138 --> 02:05:33,038
to a rich set of great native

3928
02:05:33,038 --> 02:05:34,588
applications, apps that take

3929
02:05:35,018 --> 02:05:37,088
full advantage of the power of

3930
02:05:37,088 --> 02:05:38,188
Mac technologies.

3931
02:05:38,798 --> 02:05:40,988
But Mac users also use apps

3932
02:05:41,018 --> 02:05:42,368
based on other technologies.

3933
02:05:42,908 --> 02:05:44,778
We routinely access web-based

3934
02:05:44,778 --> 02:05:46,638
experiences like Netflix that

3935
02:05:46,638 --> 02:05:48,648
build on WebKit, the

3936
02:05:48,648 --> 02:05:50,428
standards-based web technology

3937
02:05:50,428 --> 02:05:52,408
in Safari, and we also run

3938
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:54,788
sometimes cross-platform games

3939
02:05:55,178 --> 02:05:57,798
built on technology like metal.

3940
02:05:57,798 --> 02:06:00,628
And all of these platforms

3941
02:06:00,828 --> 02:06:02,148
enrich the Mac user's

3942
02:06:00,828 --> 02:06:02,148
enrich the Mac user's

3943
02:06:02,148 --> 02:06:02,918
experience.

3944
02:06:03,428 --> 02:06:05,018
But we think there's room for

3945
02:06:05,018 --> 02:06:07,178
one more, and so we'd like to

3946
02:06:07,178 --> 02:06:08,668
give you a sneak peek of a

3947
02:06:08,668 --> 02:06:10,688
multiyear project we have going

3948
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:10,928
on.

3949
02:06:11,428 --> 02:06:12,858
Because we see a huge

3950
02:06:12,858 --> 02:06:14,408
opportunity for the Mac to tap

3951
02:06:14,408 --> 02:06:16,138
into the world's most vital app

3952
02:06:16,138 --> 02:06:16,878
ecosystem.

3953
02:06:17,688 --> 02:06:18,428
It's called iOS.

3954
02:06:18,768 --> 02:06:20,328
I think you might be familiar

3955
02:06:20,328 --> 02:06:20,828
with it.

3956
02:06:21,318 --> 02:06:23,058
Now, there are millions of iOS

3957
02:06:23,138 --> 02:06:24,478
apps out there, and we think

3958
02:06:24,648 --> 02:06:26,218
some of them would be absolutely

3959
02:06:26,218 --> 02:06:28,898
great on the Mac, and Mac users

3960
02:06:28,898 --> 02:06:30,378
would love to have them there.

3961
02:06:30,428 --> 02:06:32,558
And from a technical standpoint,

3962
02:06:32,968 --> 02:06:34,448
it's actually a really good fit

3963
02:06:34,448 --> 02:06:36,488
because from day one iOS and

3964
02:06:36,488 --> 02:06:37,868
macOS have shared common

3965
02:06:37,908 --> 02:06:38,718
foundations.

3966
02:06:39,548 --> 02:06:41,638
But iOS devices and Mac devices

3967
02:06:41,638 --> 02:06:43,018
of course are different, and the

3968
02:06:43,018 --> 02:06:44,618
user interfaces are somewhat

3969
02:06:44,618 --> 02:06:46,078
different and so the frameworks

3970
02:06:46,078 --> 02:06:47,348
underneath are as well.

3971
02:06:47,348 --> 02:06:48,698
And that makes today porting an

3972
02:06:48,848 --> 02:06:51,028
app from one to the other some

3973
02:06:51,028 --> 02:06:51,408
work.

3974
02:06:52,288 --> 02:06:53,778
We wanted to make this much

3975
02:06:53,878 --> 02:06:56,658
easier, and so we've taken some

3976
02:06:56,778 --> 02:06:59,518
key frameworks from iOS and

3977
02:06:59,518 --> 02:07:00,558
brought them to the Mac.

3978
02:07:01,558 --> 02:07:03,028
And we've adapted them to

3979
02:07:01,558 --> 02:07:03,028
And we've adapted them to

3980
02:07:03,028 --> 02:07:04,828
specific Mac behaviors like use

3981
02:07:04,828 --> 02:07:07,108
of trackpad and mouse, window

3982
02:07:07,108 --> 02:07:09,278
resizing, integration of things

3983
02:07:09,278 --> 02:07:10,998
like copy and paste and drag and

3984
02:07:11,028 --> 02:07:12,678
drop into the system services on

3985
02:07:12,678 --> 02:07:12,978
the mac.

3986
02:07:13,978 --> 02:07:16,708
Now, phase one of this effort is

3987
02:07:16,708 --> 02:07:18,248
to test it on ourselves.

3988
02:07:18,798 --> 02:07:20,418
So this year in macOS, we've

3989
02:07:20,468 --> 02:07:23,608
taken some of our own iOS apps,

3990
02:07:24,138 --> 02:07:25,598
and we brought them to the Mac

3991
02:07:25,708 --> 02:07:27,158
using those technologies to make

3992
02:07:27,158 --> 02:07:28,058
sure it works well.

3993
02:07:28,688 --> 02:07:29,668
You've actually heard about

3994
02:07:29,668 --> 02:07:31,488
several of them earlier today,

3995
02:07:31,488 --> 02:07:35,168
and it turns out they make

3996
02:07:35,278 --> 02:07:37,458
fantastic Mac apps, and we're

3997
02:07:37,458 --> 02:07:39,538
able to bring them to the Mac

3998
02:07:39,598 --> 02:07:41,388
with very few code changes.

3999
02:07:42,138 --> 02:07:43,618
Now, this is going to be coming

4000
02:07:43,618 --> 02:07:45,588
to you developers next year.

4001
02:07:46,518 --> 02:07:48,408
So you can easily bring your iOS

4002
02:07:48,408 --> 02:07:50,248
apps to the Mac, and in the

4003
02:07:50,248 --> 02:07:52,068
meantime, we hope you enjoy

4004
02:07:52,068 --> 02:07:54,898
News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and

4005
02:07:54,898 --> 02:07:56,278
Home in Mojave.

4006
02:07:57,118 --> 02:07:59,178
Now we're really excited about

4007
02:07:59,178 --> 02:07:59,688
Mojave.

4008
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:03,468
From desktop, Stacks, to Finder

4009
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:03,468
From desktop, Stacks, to Finder

4010
02:08:03,468 --> 02:08:06,328
with gallery view to enhanced

4011
02:08:06,328 --> 02:08:09,738
screenshots and markup, News and

4012
02:08:09,738 --> 02:08:11,198
Home on the Mac for the first

4013
02:08:11,198 --> 02:08:11,648
time.

4014
02:08:12,578 --> 02:08:14,908
Stocks and of course the

4015
02:08:14,988 --> 02:08:16,758
redesigned Mac App Store.

4016
02:08:16,758 --> 02:08:20,088
And of course there's even more.

4017
02:08:20,428 --> 02:08:23,068
Like APFS now supports Fusion

4018
02:08:23,068 --> 02:08:25,558
and hard drives, and Safari tabs

4019
02:08:25,808 --> 02:08:27,218
can now have favicons if you

4020
02:08:27,218 --> 02:08:27,788
want them there.

4021
02:08:28,648 --> 02:08:30,768
And, of course, Group Facetime.

4022
02:08:32,118 --> 02:08:33,748
So that's macOS Mojave.

4023
02:08:33,868 --> 02:08:35,248
I hope you like it.

4024
02:08:35,248 --> 02:08:36,378
I'm going to hand it back to

4025
02:08:36,378 --> 02:08:36,508
Tim.

4026
02:08:36,508 --> 02:08:36,928

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Craig.

4029
02:08:44,738 --> 02:08:48,958
What a huge update to macOS and

4030
02:08:48,958 --> 02:08:51,208
what an extraordinary morning.

4031
02:08:52,028 --> 02:08:55,438
We got started with iOS 12 with

4032
02:08:55,438 --> 02:08:57,658
all-new capabilities including

4033
02:08:57,658 --> 02:08:58,998
taking AR further than ever

4034
02:08:58,998 --> 02:09:02,918
before, bringing Siri to any app

4035
02:08:58,998 --> 02:09:02,918
before, bringing Siri to any app

4036
02:09:03,658 --> 02:09:05,128
with Siri Shortcuts and

4037
02:09:05,168 --> 02:09:06,888
ScreenTime and cool new

4038
02:09:06,888 --> 02:09:08,398
communication features like

4039
02:09:08,398 --> 02:09:09,988
Memoji and Group Facetime.

4040
02:09:10,878 --> 02:09:12,978
And watchOS, now with Walkie

4041
02:09:12,978 --> 02:09:15,748
Talkie, Activity, Competitions,

4042
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:17,198
New Workouts, New Siri

4043
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:19,448

And Apple TV 4K now with Adobe

4045
02:09:23,308 --> 02:09:24,898
Atmos, some great new

4046
02:09:24,958 --> 02:09:27,208
partnerships, and the ease of

4047

zero sign-on.

The updates will be available to

4058

Now, before we close, we wanted

4065
02:10:06,968 --> 02:10:10,248
to celebrate you and the amazing

4066
02:10:10,248 --> 02:10:13,818
work that you do, so we went out

4067
02:10:13,818 --> 02:10:15,128
and talked to some of the most

4068
02:10:15,128 --> 02:10:17,498
important people in your lives,

4069
02:10:18,268 --> 02:10:19,758
the ones that know you the best,

4070
02:10:21,218 --> 02:10:23,268
and we made a short video, and

4071
02:10:23,268 --> 02:10:25,408
I'd love to run it for you now.

[ Music ]

4073
02:10:37,078 --> 02:10:40,168
&gt;&gt; I don't have any idea at all

4074
02:10:40,168 --> 02:10:43,708
how to create an app.

4075
02:10:43,708 --> 02:10:47,538
I don't understand any of it.

4076
02:10:47,638 --> 02:10:48,988
Ask me another question.

4077
02:10:49,188 --> 02:10:51,248
&gt;&gt; My son is a developer at

4079
02:10:51,778 --> 02:10:53,988
&gt;&gt; My daughter, Jody, is a WWDC

4080
02:10:54,058 --> 02:10:56,168
2018 scholarship winner.

4081
02:10:56,168 --> 02:10:57,258
&gt;&gt; My brother started and

4082
02:10:57,258 --> 02:10:57,768
founded Yelp.

4090
02:11:03,058 --> 02:11:03,988
&gt;&gt; My brother Derek created

4091
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:06,228
the app Refugees and Immigrants

4092
02:11:06,228 --> 02:11:07,988
the creative, the collective.

4093
02:11:08,058 --> 02:11:10,988
Why did I say the creative.

4094
02:11:11,078 --> 02:11:11,988
&gt;&gt; At Christmastime, when most

4095
02:11:12,058 --> 02:11:13,978
kids maybe would want skis or

4096
02:11:13,978 --> 02:11:15,788
something, he wanted computer

4097
02:11:15,788 --> 02:11:15,988
books.

4098
02:11:16,058 --> 02:11:18,688
He stayed in his bedroom, making

4099
02:11:18,688 --> 02:11:20,188
games while the other kids were

4100
02:11:20,188 --> 02:11:20,968
outside playing.

4101
02:11:21,078 --> 02:11:22,648
&gt;&gt; And when she is really doing

4102
02:11:22,648 --> 02:11:24,398
the coding almost always we have

4103
02:11:24,398 --> 02:11:25,988
to tell my daughter to stop,

4104
02:11:26,058 --> 02:11:26,998
but then my daughter will be

4105
02:11:26,998 --> 02:11:29,138
like, just give me another ten

4106
02:11:29,138 --> 02:11:29,598
minutes.

4107
02:11:29,598 --> 02:11:30,988
I want to get this solved first.

4108
02:11:31,058 --> 02:11:32,928
&gt;&gt; When I watch him code, his

4109
02:11:32,928 --> 02:11:36,908
eyes move in a weird way, and

4110
02:11:36,908 --> 02:11:38,818
he's like totally focused.

4111
02:11:39,278 --> 02:11:40,828
Even when my friends are over,

4112
02:11:40,828 --> 02:11:41,638
I'd say, we'll look at

4113
02:11:41,718 --> 02:11:44,058
Christopher, look at him.

4114
02:11:44,058 --> 02:11:44,838
And they'd go, wow.

4115
02:11:47,058 --> 02:11:47,988
&gt;&gt; When he first came to us with

4116
02:11:48,068 --> 02:11:50,548
the idea, we were like, okay,

4117
02:11:50,548 --> 02:11:50,968
good luck.

4118
02:11:52,508 --> 02:11:53,918
&gt;&gt; He started off in his small

4119
02:11:53,918 --> 02:11:54,988
little one-bedroom apartment

4120
02:11:54,988 --> 02:11:55,988
with next to nothing,

4121
02:11:56,588 --> 02:11:58,698
and sacrificed eating a burger

4122
02:11:58,698 --> 02:12:00,148
and just have ramen just so that

4123
02:12:00,148 --> 02:12:02,688
he could, and I'm like just buy

4124
02:12:00,148 --> 02:12:02,688
he could, and I'm like just buy

4125
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:02,988
the burger.

4126
02:12:03,078 --> 02:12:04,318
And he's like no, that's three

4127
02:12:04,318 --> 02:12:05,448
bucks that I could put towards

4128
02:12:05,448 --> 02:12:05,758
the app.

4129
02:12:06,128 --> 02:12:08,078
&gt;&gt; Jeremy went out to build the

4130
02:12:08,148 --> 02:12:09,438
first version of Yelp, and it

4131
02:12:09,438 --> 02:12:10,708
was a total bust, a total

4132
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:10,988
failure.

4133
02:12:11,058 --> 02:12:13,738
&gt;&gt; She tried really hard on a

4134
02:12:13,738 --> 02:12:15,658
couple different titles, and

4135
02:12:15,658 --> 02:12:16,828
you've never heard of them.

4136
02:12:16,828 --> 02:12:18,568
And, you know, that's a really

4137
02:12:18,568 --> 02:12:18,988
rough feeling.

4138
02:12:19,138 --> 02:12:20,978
&gt;&gt; That was definitely a low

4139
02:12:20,978 --> 02:12:22,588
point for Jeremy because it was

4140
02:12:22,588 --> 02:12:24,768
like, hey we got to retool and

4141
02:12:24,768 --> 02:12:24,988
try again.

4142
02:12:25,188 --> 02:12:27,158
What Jeremy did notice in the

4143
02:12:27,158 --> 02:12:28,568
data was that people loved

4144
02:12:28,568 --> 02:12:30,408
writing comments, and that was

4145
02:12:30,408 --> 02:12:32,078
really the genesis of the second

4146
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:33,658
version of Yelp, which worked.

4147
02:12:34,098 --> 02:12:35,678
&gt;&gt; You have to be really okay

4148
02:12:35,678 --> 02:12:37,198
with waking up to failure and

4149
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:38,848
then at the end of a whole bunch

4150
02:12:38,848 --> 02:12:39,868
of failures is something that's

4151
02:12:39,868 --> 02:12:39,988
great.

4152
02:12:42,058 --> 02:12:43,738
&gt;&gt; Tessa didn't really think I

4153
02:12:43,738 --> 02:12:44,988
want to make an app.

4154
02:12:45,158 --> 02:12:46,848
Tessa found a problem, a food

4155
02:12:46,848 --> 02:12:48,398
waste which you could use the

4156
02:12:48,398 --> 02:12:49,988
app to help to solve.

4157
02:12:50,058 --> 02:12:51,928
&gt;&gt; Emma's grandma was diagnosed

4158
02:12:51,928 --> 02:12:52,868
with Alzheimer's.

4159
02:12:53,088 --> 02:12:54,418
She even forgot my daughter's

4160
02:12:54,418 --> 02:12:54,848
birthday.

4161
02:12:55,548 --> 02:12:57,298
So Emma tried to search for an

4162
02:12:57,298 --> 02:12:57,928
app that would help,

4163
02:12:58,058 --> 02:12:58,988
but she couldn't find it.

4164
02:12:59,078 --> 02:13:02,148
So she said, you know, why don't

4165
02:12:59,078 --> 02:13:02,148
So she said, you know, why don't

4166
02:13:02,148 --> 02:13:02,928
we just do it ourselves.

4167
02:13:03,058 --> 02:13:05,468
&gt;&gt; My husband was a diabetic.

4168
02:13:05,608 --> 02:13:09,098
That inspired Jeffrey to do

4169
02:13:09,098 --> 02:13:10,688
something about diabetes, and

4170
02:13:11,568 --> 02:13:13,738
it's an answer to a lot of

4171
02:13:13,848 --> 02:13:15,078
people's prayers.

4172
02:13:17,108 --> 02:13:19,478
&gt;&gt; Jessie won the iPhone game of

4173
02:13:19,648 --> 02:13:19,818
the year.

4174
02:13:20,378 --> 02:13:21,368
I couldn't believe that he made

4175
02:13:21,368 --> 02:13:21,435
it.

4176
02:13:21,558 --> 02:13:22,988
I mean to me it was remarkable.

4177
02:13:23,508 --> 02:13:24,278
&gt;&gt; She pulled out her cell

4178
02:13:24,458 --> 02:13:26,478
phone, and I saw his app on her

4179
02:13:26,478 --> 02:13:27,368
phone, and I was like trying not

4180
02:13:27,408 --> 02:13:28,678
to freak out, but oh my gosh.

4181
02:13:29,538 --> 02:13:31,018
&gt;&gt; For my wife, it's not just

4182
02:13:31,068 --> 02:13:33,028
creating, it's really wanting to

4183
02:13:33,028 --> 02:13:34,988
be a part of something big.

4184
02:13:35,128 --> 02:13:36,268
&gt;&gt; The one lesson that I learned

4185
02:13:36,268 --> 02:13:37,468
from Jeremy every day is just

4186
02:13:37,468 --> 02:13:39,648
that determination, tenacity, to

4187
02:13:39,788 --> 02:13:39,968
focus.

4188
02:13:40,608 --> 02:13:42,278
He foresaw the impact that the

4189
02:13:42,498 --> 02:13:44,598
iPhone was going to have, and he

4190
02:13:44,598 --> 02:13:45,708
bet everything on getting an app

4191
02:13:45,708 --> 02:13:45,898
for it,

4192
02:13:46,148 --> 02:13:47,438
and I think that it was one of

4193
02:13:47,488 --> 02:13:49,648
the most important things that

4194
02:13:49,718 --> 02:13:49,938
Yelp did.

4195
02:13:50,338 --> 02:13:52,878
&gt;&gt; I think he's made a big

4196
02:13:52,878 --> 02:13:54,328
difference, and so do thousands

4197
02:13:54,328 --> 02:13:54,988
of other people.

4198
02:13:55,618 --> 02:13:57,238
&gt;&gt; She wants to not just learn

4199
02:13:57,238 --> 02:14:00,388
also teach others and it makes

4200
02:14:00,388 --> 02:14:03,068
me really proud to see her

4201
02:14:00,388 --> 02:14:03,068
me really proud to see her

4202
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:03,298
blossom.

4203
02:14:04,058 --> 02:14:05,418
&gt;&gt; As a parent, no better thing

4204
02:14:05,418 --> 02:14:06,408
is letting your kids do what

4205
02:14:06,408 --> 02:14:07,638
they want to do, because it

4206
02:14:07,698 --> 02:14:08,588
isn't how much money you've

4207
02:14:08,588 --> 02:14:08,918
made.

It's really changes you've left

behind.

pleased that some of the

developers are in the audience

4217
02:14:36,438 --> 02:14:37,148
this morning.

4218
02:14:37,668 --> 02:14:40,198
Their stories are great examples

4219
02:14:40,198 --> 02:14:42,898
of all of your passion and your

4220
02:14:42,898 --> 02:14:43,778
creativity.

4221
02:14:44,868 --> 02:14:47,228
We love the work you do and the

4222
02:14:47,228 --> 02:14:49,548
impact that it has on the world.

4223
02:14:50,348 --> 02:14:52,448
It inspires all of us at Apple

4224
02:14:52,548 --> 02:14:54,438
deeply every day.

And I'd also like to thank

4230
02:15:12,398 --> 02:15:14,478
everyone at Apple who made today

possible.

4232
02:15:15,758 --> 02:15:18,158
Days like this only come from

02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:20,258
years of effort and hard work

4234
02:15:20,258 --> 02:15:22,378
and great sacrifice, and so I

4235
02:15:22,378 --> 02:15:24,758
thank them and their families.

4236
02:15:25,338 --> 02:15:27,498
Let's have an incredible week

4237
02:15:27,558 --> 02:15:28,168

Thank you.
