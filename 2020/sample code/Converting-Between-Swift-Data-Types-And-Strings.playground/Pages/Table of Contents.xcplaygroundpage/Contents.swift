 # Converting Between Swift Data Types and Strings
 This sample illustrates how to use the various formatters available in Swift. Using formatters makes it easy to convert Swift data types into readable strings. You can also use formatters to turn strings representing numbers, dates, and measurements into Swift objects that can be manipulated. The strings are locale-aware, which is important because it allows you to localize your content based on region to support different languages, writing formats, and conventions. The playground demonstrates the conversion between Swift data types and their respective string representations based on different formatter styles and locales.
