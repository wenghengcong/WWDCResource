[ Applause ]

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:26.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:29.126 A:middle
Thank you, it's good to be here.

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:31.566 A:middle
We have some very great stuff

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:35.466 A:middle
for you today.

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:39.136 A:middle
Last year we unveiled automatic

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.836 A:middle
signing and it's great.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.086 A:middle
Automatic signing was a major

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.696 A:middle
leap forward in the ease-of-use

00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:48.016 A:middle
for how you sign your app.

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:50.866 A:middle
Today we're taking the next

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.046 A:middle
step, we're making it possible

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.856 A:middle
to use automatic signing for

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:58.446 A:middle
distribution, Xcode Build, and

00:00:58.446 --> 00:00:59.146 A:middle
Xcode Server.

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:03.126 A:middle
So, what exactly are we going to

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.656 A:middle
talk about today?

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:06.776 A:middle
The first thing is I'm going to

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.006 A:middle
very briefly review the

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.526 A:middle
fundamentals of signing and how

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:10.746 A:middle
it works on our platforms.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.336 A:middle
Next, I'm going to show you how

00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:16.346 A:middle
to set up Xcode Server to

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:17.776 A:middle
perform development signing so

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.546 A:middle
that you can regularly run tests

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.296 A:middle
on the device.

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:23.186 A:middle
Then I'm going to show you some

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:24.226 A:middle
of the great changes that we've

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:25.756 A:middle
been making to manual signing.

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:28.716 A:middle
Itai is going to come up and

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:30.136 A:middle
show you all of the great

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:31.206 A:middle
changes we've been making to

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:32.576 A:middle
distribution and distribution

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:32.946 A:middle
signing.

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:35.666 A:middle
And Brent will come up to show

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.296 A:middle
you how to set up Xcode Server

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.606 A:middle
and for the first time perform

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:39.546 A:middle
distribution signing.

00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:43.836 A:middle
So, before we get in too deep I

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:44.886 A:middle
would like to take a moment to

00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:46.646 A:middle
remind us why we do this, why do

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:47.336 A:middle
we code sign.

00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:50.576 A:middle
Well the simple answer is that

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:52.756 A:middle
code signing protects us, it

00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:54.516 A:middle
protects us as users, it

00:01:54.516 --> 00:01:56.446 A:middle
protects us as developers, and

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:58.046 A:middle
all of us are users, all of us

00:01:58.046 --> 00:01:59.696 A:middle
download apps from the store and

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:01.156 A:middle
we're sure that that app came

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:01.156 A:middle
we're sure that that app came

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:02.386 A:middle
from the developer that wrote it

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.856 A:middle
because of code signing.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:06.836 A:middle
And every app that we download

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:09.186 A:middle
from the Store we're sure that

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:11.706 A:middle
Apple has approved that that app

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:12.966 A:middle
is allowed to use special system

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:13.636 A:middle
services.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.356 A:middle
We can trust the security and

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:18.356 A:middle
the privacy of our devices

00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:19.396 A:middle
because of code signing.

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:22.036 A:middle
So how does this actually work?

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:23.896 A:middle
Well every app has a code

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:25.926 A:middle
signature and when the app is

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:27.136 A:middle
run the system checks for a

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:28.736 A:middle
couple things, it first checks

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:30.176 A:middle
that that signature is valid,

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:31.896 A:middle
that it hasn't been tampered

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:32.926 A:middle
with since it came from the

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:33.786 A:middle
original developer.

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:37.226 A:middle
And that that app is allowed to

00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:38.986 A:middle
use special system services like

00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:39.606 A:middle
app groups.

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:42.806 A:middle
And the signature also tells us

00:02:42.926 --> 00:02:44.126 A:middle
if it's been provisioned for

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:45.186 A:middle
this device, if it's for

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:46.436 A:middle
development it's been

00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:47.906 A:middle
provisioned for a couple

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:49.476 A:middle
devices, and if it's for the App

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:51.596 A:middle
Store that code signature says

00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:52.786 A:middle
it can run on any device.

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:56.136 A:middle
Now composing this signature

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:58.406 A:middle
Xcode uses three essential

00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
ingredients, our good friends

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
ingredients, our good friends

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:03.096 A:middle
the signing certificate, a

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:05.336 A:middle
provisioning profile, and

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:05.996 A:middle
entitlements.

00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:08.426 A:middle
Now I'm going to spare you a

00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:09.946 A:middle
very detailed explanation of how

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:12.576 A:middle
all of this works, but I would

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:14.276 A:middle
like to refer you to last year's

00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:16.056 A:middle
talk, what's new in Xcode app

00:03:16.056 --> 00:03:17.566 A:middle
signing where we go into great

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.186 A:middle
detail about how this works with

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:20.546 A:middle
our platforms and how it works

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:21.366 A:middle
with Xcode 8.

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:25.366 A:middle
What I will say is that

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:27.726 A:middle
collecting all of these assets

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:30.616 A:middle
it's not that much fun, it's

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:33.766 A:middle
complex which is why in Xcode 8

00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:35.126 A:middle
we introduced a solution to

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:36.606 A:middle
manage all of this complexity,

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:38.696 A:middle
automatic signing.

00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:41.566 A:middle
When you enable automatically

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:43.226 A:middle
managed signing Xcode will

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:45.346 A:middle
automatically create app IDs, it

00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:46.606 A:middle
will create certificates, it

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:47.796 A:middle
will update provisioning

00:03:47.796 --> 00:03:49.406 A:middle
profiles, it will update

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:50.946 A:middle
entitlements, it will do all of

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:52.016 A:middle
that stuff you don't want to

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:53.596 A:middle
deal with so that you can get on

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:54.346 A:middle
with your development.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.316 A:middle
Enabling automatic signing is

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:58.096 A:middle
really the way to go.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.376 A:middle
And I'm pleased to announce that

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.376 A:middle
And I'm pleased to announce that

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:04.226 A:middle
in Xcode 9 all of this great

00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:06.326 A:middle
functionality is available in

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:07.126 A:middle
Xcode Server.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:10.606 A:middle
And we know that there are

00:04:10.606 --> 00:04:11.906 A:middle
certain situations in which

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:12.836 A:middle
you'd like to directly

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:13.926 A:middle
manipulate your signing

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:15.936 A:middle
configuration so we also have

00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:18.396 A:middle
manual signing support in Xcode

00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:18.706 A:middle
Server.

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:22.556 A:middle
So, for those of you who don't

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:23.866 A:middle
know I hope you know that Xcode

00:04:23.866 --> 00:04:25.096 A:middle
Server is the continuous

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:27.006 A:middle
integration service powered by

00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:30.396 A:middle
Xcode and now it is built right

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:31.176 A:middle
into Xcode.

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:32.286 A:middle
You no longer need to have

00:04:32.286 --> 00:04:33.366 A:middle
Server App installed.

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:34.756 A:middle
If you've used this before this

00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:36.566 A:middle
is a huge convenience, it has

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:37.916 A:middle
never been easier to get going

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.176 A:middle
with continuous integration.

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:43.486 A:middle
And Xcode Server allows you to

00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:45.666 A:middle
very easily set up testing on

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:49.276 A:middle
the simulator and on the device.

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:51.336 A:middle
Now testing on the device

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:54.236 A:middle
requires code signing, so I'd

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.596 A:middle
like to explain how code signing

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.846 A:middle
fits into the greater picture of

00:04:57.846 --> 00:04:58.436 A:middle
Xcode Server.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:01.686 A:middle
When you're working on your app

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:05.406 A:middle
in Xcode you work on a project

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.336 A:middle
and you upload updates to that

00:05:07.336 --> 00:05:09.156 A:middle
project to a remote repository.

00:05:10.246 --> 00:05:11.596 A:middle
You then set up Xcode Server

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:12.946 A:middle
with a bot to pull from that

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:15.476 A:middle
repository, build your app and

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:16.916 A:middle
run tests on the device.

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:19.716 A:middle
And running on a device requires

00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:22.776 A:middle
a code signature and Xcode

00:05:22.776 --> 00:05:24.246 A:middle
composes that code signature

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:25.156 A:middle
using those essential

00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:26.306 A:middle
ingredients, the provisioning

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.776 A:middle
profile and a signing

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:28.386 A:middle
certificate.

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:29.776 A:middle
So, how are we going to get

00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.316 A:middle
those onto Xcode Server?

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.386 A:middle
Well the good news is if you

00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:36.666 A:middle
have targets enabled with

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:38.566 A:middle
automatic signing this can just

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:39.306 A:middle
happen for you.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:42.086 A:middle
Xcode Server will automatically

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:43.506 A:middle
create certificates, it will

00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:45.076 A:middle
update provisioning profiles, it

00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:47.366 A:middle
will register devices all so

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:48.666 A:middle
that signing can be performed.

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:49.876 A:middle
This is really fantastic.

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:53.186 A:middle
And if you have manual setup for

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.896 A:middle
your targets Xcode Server now

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:57.346 A:middle
has UI for you to send any

00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:58.866 A:middle
certificates from your

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:02.216 A:middle
administrative Mac over to the

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:02.216 A:middle
administrative Mac over to the

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:03.376 A:middle
server that will be performing

00:06:03.376 --> 00:06:04.686 A:middle
integrations in code signing.

00:06:05.376 --> 00:06:08.356 A:middle
So, Xcode Server now has support

00:06:08.776 --> 00:06:10.056 A:middle
for automatic and manual

00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:10.406 A:middle
signing.

00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:15.206 A:middle
Now Xcode Server is able to make

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:16.976 A:middle
use of automatic signing because

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.956 A:middle
you join Xcode Server to your

00:06:18.956 --> 00:06:20.546 A:middle
team as another member, you do

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.066 A:middle
this during Xcode Server setup

00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:23.906 A:middle
if you're a team agent or admin.

00:06:25.026 --> 00:06:27.196 A:middle
And Xcode Server now supports

00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:29.466 A:middle
logins from Apple IDs with two

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:30.476 A:middle
factor authentication.

00:06:31.656 --> 00:06:33.826 A:middle
Now all of this great signing

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.356 A:middle
functionality is available to

00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:37.656 A:middle
Xcode Server because Xcode

00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:39.196 A:middle
Server under the hood calls out

00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:40.366 A:middle
to the command line tool

00:06:40.796 --> 00:06:43.696 A:middle
Xcodebuild, which means that

00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:46.106 A:middle
Xcode Build now offers command

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.356 A:middle
line support for automatic

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:48.906 A:middle
signing repairs and this is

00:06:48.906 --> 00:06:49.366 A:middle
huge.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.576 A:middle
Now if you have a third-party

00:06:52.576 --> 00:06:54.116 A:middle
continuous integration service

00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:55.456 A:middle
you should listen up because

00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:56.576 A:middle
what this means is that

00:06:57.366 --> 00:06:58.936 A:middle
Xcodebuild can now update

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.446 A:middle
provisioning profiles, it can

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.446 A:middle
provisioning profiles, it can

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:02.066 A:middle
download them, it can create

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:03.466 A:middle
certificates, all that magic

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:04.956 A:middle
that happens in the UI can now

00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:05.976 A:middle
happen on the command line.

00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:13.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:14.586 A:middle
And you enable this in

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:16.666 A:middle
Xcodebuild by passing the flag

00:07:16.716 --> 00:07:18.276 A:middle
allowProvisioningUpdates.

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:20.566 A:middle
And we've added some extra

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:22.246 A:middle
automation, if you have a device

00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:24.486 A:middle
connected to your Mac you can

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.926 A:middle
have it automatically registered

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:26.886 A:middle
with your team without

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:28.446 A:middle
interaction if you also pass the

00:07:28.446 --> 00:07:30.136 A:middle
flag allowProvisioning

00:07:30.136 --> 00:07:32.956 A:middle
DeviceRegistration so very cool.

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:36.866 A:middle
So, as I've said, setting up

00:07:36.996 --> 00:07:38.896 A:middle
Xcode Server is super easy now

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:40.716 A:middle
that it's built right into Xcode

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:41.086 A:middle
9.

00:07:41.476 --> 00:07:42.986 A:middle
I'd like to show you how you set

00:07:42.986 --> 00:07:45.256 A:middle
up Xcode Server briefly so that

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.276 A:middle
I can show you how to set up

00:07:46.276 --> 00:07:47.286 A:middle
signing for that server.

00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:51.156 A:middle
So, the first step is opening up

00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:53.606 A:middle
the preferences of Xcode and all

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:54.466 A:middle
the way to the right we have a

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:56.466 A:middle
new tab Server and Bots, that's

00:07:56.466 --> 00:07:57.906 A:middle
where you turn on Xcode Server.

00:07:58.796 --> 00:08:01.286 A:middle
The next step is opening up the

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.796 --> 00:08:01.286 A:middle
The next step is opening up the

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:04.216 A:middle
accounts pane where you can add

00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:06.336 A:middle
a client account that way you

00:08:06.336 --> 00:08:08.076 A:middle
can view your server working.

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:11.346 A:middle
The next step is opening up your

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:13.016 A:middle
project and using the product

00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:14.356 A:middle
menu to create a bot.

00:08:15.556 --> 00:08:16.616 A:middle
And then in the reports

00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:18.306 A:middle
navigator you can view all the

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:19.606 A:middle
integrations that your bot has

00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:21.276 A:middle
been running, you can see all

00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:23.286 A:middle
the servers and bots and on each

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.486 A:middle
integration you can see whether

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:26.946 A:middle
your project has built, whether

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.076 A:middle
tests you have have run and

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:30.066 A:middle
whether they've succeeded or

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:33.525 A:middle
failed that's what you can see

00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:33.816 A:middle
here.

00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:35.846 A:middle
And now when you set up Xcode

00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:37.546 A:middle
Server there's a new tab, the

00:08:37.546 --> 00:08:38.895 A:middle
signing tab, this is what it

00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:39.336 A:middle
looks like.

00:08:40.296 --> 00:08:42.376 A:middle
This gives a number of options

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:43.716 A:middle
so that you can set up Xcode

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:45.636 A:middle
Server to be powered to use

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:46.476 A:middle
automatic signing.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.796 A:middle
This first checkbox, allow Xcode

00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:50.266 A:middle
Server to manage my certificates

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:51.806 A:middle
and profile, will give Xcode

00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:53.126 A:middle
Server the power to use

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.676 A:middle
automatic signing for any of

00:08:54.676 --> 00:08:55.726 A:middle
those targets in which it's

00:08:55.726 --> 00:08:56.096 A:middle
enabled.

00:08:56.966 --> 00:08:58.646 A:middle
And you authorize that again by

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.536 A:middle
adding Xcode Server to your team

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.536 A:middle
adding Xcode Server to your team

00:09:00.536 --> 00:09:01.366 A:middle
and to do that here.

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:03.856 A:middle
And then there's this other

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:05.436 A:middle
checkbox, automatically add

00:09:05.436 --> 00:09:06.946 A:middle
missing devices to my developer

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:08.266 A:middle
team, this will automatically

00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:10.046 A:middle
register any devices connected

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:12.346 A:middle
to your Mac without interaction.

00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:14.266 A:middle
And those two checkboxes in the

00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:15.796 A:middle
UI mirror those flags,

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:17.436 A:middle
allowProvisioningUpdates and

00:09:17.476 --> 00:09:18.266 A:middle
allowProvisioning

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.476 A:middle
DeviceRegistration for up

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:20.286 A:middle
Xcodebuild.

00:09:21.476 --> 00:09:23.206 A:middle
So, I've said enough why don't I

00:09:23.206 --> 00:09:23.976 A:middle
actually show you this working.

00:09:30.046 --> 00:09:34.036 A:middle
Okay, so I have opened up Xcode

00:09:34.036 --> 00:09:36.606 A:middle
to my project chocolate chip and

00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:39.046 A:middle
I have already set up server

00:09:39.636 --> 00:09:41.356 A:middle
with a bot to perform

00:09:41.356 --> 00:09:43.286 A:middle
integrations on the simulator.

00:09:43.936 --> 00:09:45.296 A:middle
So, I've just purchased this

00:09:45.296 --> 00:09:46.836 A:middle
shiny new device and I'd like to

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.786 A:middle
run tests on the device.

00:09:48.886 --> 00:09:50.556 A:middle
In order to do that I need to

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.326 A:middle
enable Xcode Server to make use

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:53.226 A:middle
of automatic signing.

00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:56.616 A:middle
So, first step is clicking on

00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:57.836 A:middle
the reports navigator and you

00:09:57.836 --> 00:09:59.136 A:middle
can see here the server that

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:00.816 A:middle
I've created, the bot, and the

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:00.816 A:middle
I've created, the bot, and the

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
one integration that's run.

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.956 A:middle
And I'm going to control

00:10:04.956 --> 00:10:06.346 A:middle
Control-click and bring up the

00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:07.016 A:middle
bot editor.

00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:09.186 A:middle
So, my first step will be

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:10.526 A:middle
clicking on the devices tab

00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:11.726 A:middle
where you can see that I've set

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:14.566 A:middle
up Xcode Server to run tests on

00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:16.366 A:middle
the iPhone SE simulator, I'm

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:17.866 A:middle
going to change that instead to

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:19.026 A:middle
run on any device that's

00:10:19.026 --> 00:10:20.096 A:middle
connected to this Mac.

00:10:20.906 --> 00:10:23.686 A:middle
Next, in the signing tab you can

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:24.706 A:middle
see what we've been talking

00:10:24.706 --> 00:10:24.986 A:middle
about.

00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:28.006 A:middle
I'm going to allow Xcode Server

00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:29.256 A:middle
to create certificates and

00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:32.016 A:middle
profiles, I'm going to add Xcode

00:10:32.016 --> 00:10:34.936 A:middle
Server to my team, and I'm going

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:35.976 A:middle
to allow Xcode Server to

00:10:35.976 --> 00:10:37.386 A:middle
automatically register any

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.476 A:middle
device that's connected,

00:10:38.476 --> 00:10:39.266 A:middle
including this one.

00:10:40.586 --> 00:10:42.106 A:middle
All right, so we're all ready to

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:43.486 A:middle
get started testing on the

00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:44.026 A:middle
device.

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.846 A:middle
I'm going to manually initiate

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:46.566 A:middle
an integration.

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:49.436 A:middle
So, what's happening now is

00:10:49.436 --> 00:10:52.186 A:middle
Xcode Server is downloading the

00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:53.686 A:middle
project from the repository,

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:56.036 A:middle
it's building the app, it's

00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:57.236 A:middle
creating a certificate,

00:10:57.236 --> 00:10:59.336 A:middle
registering my device, adding

00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:00.626 A:middle
that device to the profile,

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:00.626 A:middle
that device to the profile,

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:01.736 A:middle
downloading the profile, and

00:11:01.736 --> 00:11:03.896 A:middle
signing it also so that we can

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.286 A:middle
run tests on the device.

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:07.936 A:middle
And normally I would say don't

00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:09.026 A:middle
watch your bot it's not that

00:11:09.026 --> 00:11:10.386 A:middle
much fun, you can let this

00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:12.456 A:middle
automate itself in another room,

00:11:12.896 --> 00:11:15.216 A:middle
but after a certain amount of

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.616 A:middle
bake time our cookies will be

00:11:16.616 --> 00:11:16.986 A:middle
done.

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:22.396 A:middle
And there we go, all two of my

00:11:22.396 --> 00:11:24.176 A:middle
tests have passed, I'm in very

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:24.636 A:middle
good shape.

00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:32.956 A:middle
So, you've just seen how you can

00:11:32.956 --> 00:11:35.426 A:middle
set up Xcode Server to

00:11:35.426 --> 00:11:36.566 A:middle
automatically perform

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:37.856 A:middle
development signing so that you

00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:42.196 A:middle
can run tests on the device.

00:11:42.356 --> 00:11:45.286 A:middle
Now we really like automatic

00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:47.716 A:middle
signing, we don't want you to be

00:11:47.716 --> 00:11:49.386 A:middle
consumed with managing all of

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:50.976 A:middle
these assets, we want to be

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:52.286 A:middle
coding, we want you to be coding

00:11:52.286 --> 00:11:52.716 A:middle
as well.

00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:55.356 A:middle
Setting automatic signing I do

00:11:55.356 --> 00:11:56.996 A:middle
it, we suggest everyone do it.

00:11:58.246 --> 00:11:59.676 A:middle
However, we know that there are

00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:01.206 A:middle
certain situations in which you

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:01.206 A:middle
certain situations in which you

00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:03.266 A:middle
may want to directly manipulate

00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:04.926 A:middle
your signing configuration and

00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:07.116 A:middle
for that we have manual signing

00:12:07.356 --> 00:12:08.846 A:middle
and now we've improved it.

00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:12.906 A:middle
We've added some improvements to

00:12:12.906 --> 00:12:14.936 A:middle
the certificate sheet in the

00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:16.056 A:middle
accounts preferences.

00:12:16.746 --> 00:12:18.886 A:middle
Now this sheet will tell you

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:20.766 A:middle
what certificates you've created

00:12:21.566 --> 00:12:23.286 A:middle
on your Mac and other Macs that

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:23.676 A:middle
you own.

00:12:24.196 --> 00:12:26.106 A:middle
That's the developer

00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:27.576 A:middle
certificates above and in the

00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:29.686 A:middle
section below you can see all of

00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:31.116 A:middle
the distribution certificates

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:32.716 A:middle
that have been created by anyone

00:12:32.716 --> 00:12:34.606 A:middle
on your team, whether they're on

00:12:34.606 --> 00:12:35.476 A:middle
your machine or not.

00:12:35.846 --> 00:12:36.606 A:middle
And we've improved the

00:12:36.606 --> 00:12:38.356 A:middle
visibility here, now you can see

00:12:38.356 --> 00:12:40.946 A:middle
when a certificate is missing a

00:12:40.946 --> 00:12:42.546 A:middle
private key or it's been revoked

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:44.306 A:middle
and we even include the creator

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:45.936 A:middle
of the certificate and you can

00:12:45.936 --> 00:12:47.256 A:middle
email the creator of that

00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:48.726 A:middle
certificate right from the sheet

00:12:48.966 --> 00:12:50.016 A:middle
and asked them to share it with

00:12:50.056 --> 00:12:50.186 A:middle
you.

00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:56.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:57.866 A:middle
In the project editor when

00:12:57.866 --> 00:12:59.476 A:middle
you're using manual you select

00:12:59.476 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
the profile yourself and we've

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.476 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
the profile yourself and we've

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:03.286 A:middle
added a new menu item download

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:04.796 A:middle
profile it'll bring up a sheet

00:13:04.796 --> 00:13:05.636 A:middle
that looks like this.

00:13:06.196 --> 00:13:07.476 A:middle
And you can see on the left a

00:13:07.526 --> 00:13:09.906 A:middle
list of eligible profiles from

00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:11.456 A:middle
profiles that I've created on

00:13:11.456 --> 00:13:13.066 A:middle
the portal and these are

00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:14.596 A:middle
profiles that are eligible for

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:15.266 A:middle
my target.

00:13:15.876 --> 00:13:17.026 A:middle
When I've selected one you can

00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:18.946 A:middle
see a detailed view of that

00:13:18.946 --> 00:13:20.706 A:middle
profile and see how it compares

00:13:20.706 --> 00:13:22.556 A:middle
with your target, whether the

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:24.436 A:middle
capabilities match, even if the

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:25.776 A:middle
device is connected you can see

00:13:25.776 --> 00:13:26.616 A:middle
if that device is in the

00:13:26.616 --> 00:13:27.216 A:middle
profile.

00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:28.906 A:middle
This is a major improvement for

00:13:28.906 --> 00:13:30.956 A:middle
finding the right profile before

00:13:30.956 --> 00:13:32.176 A:middle
you select it and try to sign

00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:32.726 A:middle
with it.

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.736 A:middle
And if you have a profile

00:13:34.736 --> 00:13:37.376 A:middle
selected already, but it's not

00:13:37.376 --> 00:13:38.346 A:middle
installed locally on your

00:13:38.346 --> 00:13:40.056 A:middle
machine Xcode will offer to

00:13:40.056 --> 00:13:42.466 A:middle
download that profile for you if

00:13:42.616 --> 00:13:43.756 A:middle
we know it will work.

00:13:44.286 --> 00:13:45.446 A:middle
Now we know that you're still in

00:13:45.446 --> 00:13:46.706 A:middle
manual, we're not interested in

00:13:46.706 --> 00:13:47.876 A:middle
touching your project state or

00:13:47.876 --> 00:13:48.886 A:middle
your portal state, we're very

00:13:48.886 --> 00:13:50.156 A:middle
clear about this distinction,

00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:51.506 A:middle
this is really just a

00:13:51.506 --> 00:13:52.096 A:middle
convenience.

00:13:52.846 --> 00:13:55.836 A:middle
And of course, in Xcode Server

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:57.256 A:middle
we also have manual support.

00:13:58.206 --> 00:13:59.486 A:middle
Under the signing tab you'll see

00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:00.866 A:middle
a tab that's like this, the

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:00.866 A:middle
a tab that's like this, the

00:14:00.866 --> 00:14:02.426 A:middle
certificates and profiles tab,

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:03.666 A:middle
where you can see a list of the

00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:05.756 A:middle
certificates and profiles

00:14:05.756 --> 00:14:07.726 A:middle
installed on your local machine

00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:09.256 A:middle
that you can send over to your

00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:10.526 A:middle
server to perform manual

00:14:10.526 --> 00:14:10.886 A:middle
signing.

00:14:11.246 --> 00:14:14.716 A:middle
So, when you are using manual

00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:16.226 A:middle
signing we recommend using the

00:14:16.226 --> 00:14:18.326 A:middle
general tab to make any changes

00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:19.356 A:middle
to your signing setup.

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:23.276 A:middle
However, if you have automation

00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:25.816 A:middle
or at you just don't want to use

00:14:25.816 --> 00:14:28.786 A:middle
the UI, we have build settings

00:14:28.866 --> 00:14:30.066 A:middle
for extra flexibility.

00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:32.136 A:middle
In Xcode 8 we introduced

00:14:32.486 --> 00:14:34.296 A:middle
Development Team that's to set

00:14:34.296 --> 00:14:35.296 A:middle
the team identifier.

00:14:36.606 --> 00:14:38.496 A:middle
Provisioning Profile Specifier

00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:40.366 A:middle
to set the profile by name.

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:43.836 A:middle
And Code Sign Identity to set

00:14:44.036 --> 00:14:44.766 A:middle
the certificate.

00:14:46.346 --> 00:14:48.666 A:middle
And in Xcode 9 we're introducing

00:14:48.666 --> 00:14:51.736 A:middle
a new build setting Code Sign

00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:52.146 A:middle
Style.

00:14:53.286 --> 00:14:55.256 A:middle
You can use Code Sign Style to

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:58.186 A:middle
set the style to automatic or

00:14:58.186 --> 00:15:00.566 A:middle
manual at the target or build

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.186 --> 00:15:00.566 A:middle
manual at the target or build

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:01.606 A:middle
configuration level.

00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:04.126 A:middle
We think that this is exciting,

00:15:04.126 --> 00:15:06.096 A:middle
but it's for advanced use cases.

00:15:06.146 --> 00:15:08.046 A:middle
For most cases, you should be

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:09.776 A:middle
able to set your entire target,

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:11.326 A:middle
keep it set to automatic.

00:15:13.206 --> 00:15:15.406 A:middle
Well you've seen just about all

00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:16.396 A:middle
there is for development

00:15:16.396 --> 00:15:16.836 A:middle
signing.

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:18.426 A:middle
We've made a lot of great

00:15:18.426 --> 00:15:20.116 A:middle
improvements to distribution and

00:15:20.116 --> 00:15:21.146 A:middle
distribution signing.

00:15:21.696 --> 00:15:23.036 A:middle
For more on that please give a

00:15:23.036 --> 00:15:25.066 A:middle
warm welcome to my friend, Itai

00:15:25.656 --> 00:15:25.976 A:middle
Rom.

00:15:26.516 --> 00:15:33.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Chris, good

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:36.016 A:middle
afternoon everyone.

00:15:36.866 --> 00:15:38.046 A:middle
So, Chris just showed you all

00:15:38.046 --> 00:15:39.616 A:middle
the improvements we've made when

00:15:39.616 --> 00:15:40.726 A:middle
your development signing your

00:15:40.726 --> 00:15:40.956 A:middle
app.

00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:42.676 A:middle
I'd like to change gears a bit

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:44.546 A:middle
and talk about distribution.

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:46.746 A:middle
Now when you're ready to share

00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:48.196 A:middle
your app with others the first

00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:49.636 A:middle
thing you need to do is build an

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:50.156 A:middle
archive.

00:15:51.496 --> 00:15:53.296 A:middle
An archive is a special release

00:15:53.346 --> 00:15:55.316 A:middle
build of your application and we

00:15:55.316 --> 00:15:56.576 A:middle
recommend development signing

00:15:56.576 --> 00:15:56.756 A:middle
it.

00:15:57.066 --> 00:15:58.236 A:middle
In fact, that's the default

00:15:58.236 --> 00:15:58.576 A:middle
setting.

00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:00.926 A:middle
Now the reason that we recommend

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:00.926 A:middle
Now the reason that we recommend

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.026 A:middle
that this is so that any

00:16:02.026 --> 00:16:03.606 A:middle
developer on your team can

00:16:03.606 --> 00:16:04.826 A:middle
easily build an archive and

00:16:04.826 --> 00:16:06.256 A:middle
share it with others without

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.946 A:middle
needing access to any special

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.026 A:middle
distribution signing

00:16:09.026 --> 00:16:09.696 A:middle
certificates.

00:16:10.656 --> 00:16:13.276 A:middle
The archive contains both the

00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:14.836 A:middle
machine code and bitcode of your

00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:16.266 A:middle
app, as well as your debugging

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:18.776 A:middle
symbols all bundled up together.

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.166 A:middle
And once you've built one of

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:22.026 A:middle
these you can use Xcode's

00:16:22.026 --> 00:16:23.766 A:middle
organizer window to generate an

00:16:23.856 --> 00:16:25.306 A:middle
IPA and upload it to the App

00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:25.616 A:middle
Store.

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:29.226 A:middle
When you generate that IPA Xcode

00:16:29.226 --> 00:16:30.846 A:middle
will distribution sign your app

00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:32.396 A:middle
according to App Store

00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:33.056 A:middle
requirements.

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.036 A:middle
So, this is the other part of

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.166 A:middle
why you can develop sign your

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:37.526 A:middle
archives because Xcode will

00:16:37.526 --> 00:16:38.916 A:middle
resign your app when you

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:39.786 A:middle
distribute it.

00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:42.016 A:middle
In fact, you can distribute your

00:16:42.016 --> 00:16:43.386 A:middle
archive in a variety of ways.

00:16:44.056 --> 00:16:45.976 A:middle
You can ad hoc distribution sign

00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:47.676 A:middle
it if you want to share the app

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:48.996 A:middle
with other people on your team

00:16:48.996 --> 00:16:51.026 A:middle
or your QA engineers or if

00:16:51.026 --> 00:16:51.646 A:middle
you're a member of the

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:53.676 A:middle
Enterprise Developer Program you

00:16:53.676 --> 00:16:55.796 A:middle
can enterprise sign it and share

00:16:55.796 --> 00:16:57.596 A:middle
the app with other employees in

00:16:58.246 --> 00:16:59.446 A:middle
your company.

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:00.506 A:middle
Now, in addition to the

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:00.506 A:middle
Now, in addition to the

00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:02.066 A:middle
distribution method there are a

00:17:02.066 --> 00:17:03.276 A:middle
lot of other choices you need to

00:17:03.276 --> 00:17:04.336 A:middle
make when you distribute your

00:17:05.306 --> 00:17:05.396 A:middle
app.

00:17:05.476 --> 00:17:06.455 A:middle
You need to choose how you want

00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:07.796 A:middle
to sign it, which profiles to

00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:08.935 A:middle
use, which entitlements it

00:17:08.935 --> 00:17:09.226 A:middle
needs.

00:17:09.856 --> 00:17:11.656 A:middle
If you're using bitcode, app

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.776 A:middle
thinning or on demand resources

00:17:14.086 --> 00:17:15.236 A:middle
then you also need to decide how

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:16.086 A:middle
you want to handle those

00:17:16.086 --> 00:17:16.556 A:middle
features.

00:17:16.796 --> 00:17:17.746 A:middle
And if you're uploading to the

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:18.846 A:middle
App Store then you need to

00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:19.756 A:middle
decide whether you want to

00:17:19.756 --> 00:17:20.786 A:middle
include symbols or not.

00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:23.445 A:middle
So, this can get quite complex.

00:17:24.756 --> 00:17:26.086 A:middle
I'm pleased to announce that in

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:27.366 A:middle
Xcode 9 we've made some major

00:17:27.366 --> 00:17:28.756 A:middle
improvements to the distribution

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:29.916 A:middle
workflow that will make it

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:31.456 A:middle
easier than ever before to share

00:17:31.456 --> 00:17:33.536 A:middle
your apps with others while also

00:17:33.536 --> 00:17:34.716 A:middle
giving you more power and

00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:35.916 A:middle
control over the process.

00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:38.126 A:middle
Now the first thing we've added

00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:39.556 A:middle
is automatic signing.

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:43.066 A:middle
This works just like during

00:17:43.066 --> 00:17:44.606 A:middle
development, so Xcode will take

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:45.826 A:middle
care of all the distribution

00:17:45.826 --> 00:17:47.876 A:middle
signing details for you and you

00:17:47.876 --> 00:17:49.206 A:middle
can focus on other tasks.

00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:51.616 A:middle
In addition to automatic signing

00:17:52.576 --> 00:17:53.636 A:middle
for those of you who want full

00:17:53.636 --> 00:17:55.266 A:middle
control we've added manual

00:17:55.266 --> 00:17:56.466 A:middle
signing to the distribution

00:17:56.466 --> 00:17:56.876 A:middle
workflow.

00:17:57.666 --> 00:17:59.226 A:middle
So now you can create your own

00:17:59.226 --> 00:18:00.626 A:middle
distribution profiles and tell

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.226 --> 00:18:00.626 A:middle
distribution profiles and tell

00:18:00.626 --> 00:18:02.316 A:middle
Xcode which ones to use, but

00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:03.506 A:middle
Xcode will never create or

00:18:03.506 --> 00:18:05.246 A:middle
modify any of those profiles.

00:18:06.416 --> 00:18:09.596 A:middle
In addition to automatic and

00:18:09.596 --> 00:18:10.606 A:middle
manual resigning we've made a

00:18:10.606 --> 00:18:11.776 A:middle
lot of other improvements.

00:18:12.136 --> 00:18:12.996 A:middle
We've streamlined the

00:18:12.996 --> 00:18:14.016 A:middle
distribution workflow.

00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:16.246 A:middle
So, for example Xcode won't ask

00:18:16.246 --> 00:18:17.276 A:middle
you which Development Team you

00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:18.766 A:middle
want to use anymore because it

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:19.766 A:middle
already knows the answer.

00:18:21.516 --> 00:18:25.936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:27.286 A:middle
We've also improved the

00:18:27.286 --> 00:18:29.466 A:middle
visibility of errors, so now

00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:30.756 A:middle
it's easier to tell what went

00:18:30.756 --> 00:18:31.716 A:middle
wrong when you run into a

00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:32.946 A:middle
problem and what you need to do

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.206 A:middle
to resolve it.

00:18:35.556 --> 00:18:36.646 A:middle
We've enhanced export

00:18:36.646 --> 00:18:39.536 A:middle
functionality, so now in Xcode 9

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.086 A:middle
once you've uploaded your app to

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:42.786 A:middle
the App Store you can save a

00:18:42.786 --> 00:18:44.226 A:middle
copy of your IPA in case you

00:18:44.226 --> 00:18:45.496 A:middle
need to refer back to it later

00:18:45.496 --> 00:18:45.706 A:middle
on.

00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:48.966 A:middle
And finally, we've enhanced the

00:18:48.966 --> 00:18:49.966 A:middle
command line support in

00:18:49.966 --> 00:18:51.446 A:middle
Xcodebuild so that you can take

00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:52.566 A:middle
advantage of all these new

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:54.326 A:middle
features in your automation.

00:18:54.906 --> 00:18:57.276 A:middle
Let's dive into automatic

00:18:57.276 --> 00:18:58.206 A:middle
signing a little bit more.

00:18:58.946 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
This works just like development

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.946 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
This works just like development

00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:02.736 A:middle
signing, Xcode will create

00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:04.446 A:middle
Xcode-managed distribution

00:19:04.446 --> 00:19:04.976 A:middle
profiles.

00:19:05.296 --> 00:19:06.256 A:middle
These are profiles that are

00:19:06.256 --> 00:19:08.076 A:middle
completely under Xcode's control

00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:10.596 A:middle
and they're the only profiles

00:19:10.596 --> 00:19:11.666 A:middle
that Xcode will use for

00:19:11.666 --> 00:19:13.056 A:middle
automatic distribution signing.

00:19:13.436 --> 00:19:14.916 A:middle
It will never touch or use any

00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:16.416 A:middle
of your manually made profiles.

00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:19.076 A:middle
In addition, Xcode will make it

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:20.236 A:middle
easy to create and share your

00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:21.286 A:middle
distribution certificates.

00:19:21.736 --> 00:19:22.616 A:middle
These are different from

00:19:22.616 --> 00:19:23.946 A:middle
development certificates because

00:19:23.946 --> 00:19:25.776 A:middle
their team owned signing assets.

00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:27.146 A:middle
So, it's really important that

00:19:27.146 --> 00:19:28.386 A:middle
you know when you've created one

00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:30.356 A:middle
and you save it so that you can

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:31.646 A:middle
reinstall it later or share it

00:19:31.646 --> 00:19:32.226 A:middle
with others.

00:19:32.926 --> 00:19:34.776 A:middle
And finally, last but not least,

00:19:35.246 --> 00:19:36.626 A:middle
for those of you with carefully

00:19:36.626 --> 00:19:38.776 A:middle
crafted signing setups in Xcode

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:40.406 A:middle
9 Xcode will never offer to

00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:41.356 A:middle
revoke a distribution

00:19:41.356 --> 00:19:41.896 A:middle
certificate.

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:45.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:47.086 A:middle
Yes, we're all very happy about

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:47.446 A:middle
that one.

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:48.656 A:middle
So, you don't have to worry

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:50.126 A:middle
about any enterprising member of

00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:51.816 A:middle
your team ruining your carefully

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.176 A:middle
crafted setup through Xcode

00:19:53.176 --> 00:19:53.506 A:middle
anymore.

00:19:54.616 --> 00:19:56.786 A:middle
So, here's an example of

00:19:56.786 --> 00:19:57.976 A:middle
improved error presentation.

00:19:58.046 --> 00:19:59.946 A:middle
This is a common and potentially

00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:01.826 A:middle
confusing situation, someone on

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:01.826 A:middle
confusing situation, someone on

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.126 A:middle
your team has already created

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:04.366 A:middle
the distribution certificate,

00:20:04.676 --> 00:20:05.536 A:middle
but you don't have that

00:20:05.536 --> 00:20:07.876 A:middle
certificate or more likely you

00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:08.976 A:middle
don't have its private key.

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:11.106 A:middle
Well now Xcode 9 tells you

00:20:11.106 --> 00:20:12.266 A:middle
exactly who created those

00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:13.866 A:middle
certificates, makes it really

00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:15.626 A:middle
easy to contact them so you can

00:20:15.626 --> 00:20:16.816 A:middle
get the information you need to

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:17.716 A:middle
finish the workflow.

00:20:18.796 --> 00:20:19.906 A:middle
Now that's just one example,

00:20:19.906 --> 00:20:21.006 A:middle
there are many others throughout

00:20:21.006 --> 00:20:22.396 A:middle
the distribution workflow of

00:20:22.396 --> 00:20:23.356 A:middle
improved errors.

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:26.446 A:middle
The enhanced export

00:20:26.446 --> 00:20:27.066 A:middle
functionality.

00:20:27.806 --> 00:20:29.686 A:middle
So, as I mentioned earlier, now

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:31.216 A:middle
it's easy to save aside a copy

00:20:31.216 --> 00:20:32.276 A:middle
of your IPA after you've

00:20:32.276 --> 00:20:33.886 A:middle
uploaded it to the App Store,

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.096 A:middle
but you get more than that.

00:20:35.726 --> 00:20:36.396 A:middle
We also give you a

00:20:36.396 --> 00:20:37.816 A:middle
DistributionSummary.plist so

00:20:37.816 --> 00:20:39.436 A:middle
just like a receipt, it shows

00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:41.096 A:middle
you all the content in your IPA,

00:20:41.266 --> 00:20:42.806 A:middle
how Xcode resigned it, which

00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:44.806 A:middle
entitlements it has and so on.

00:20:45.706 --> 00:20:47.006 A:middle
You also get a Packaging.log

00:20:47.006 --> 00:20:48.586 A:middle
which is like a Build.log, it

00:20:48.586 --> 00:20:50.396 A:middle
shows you step-by-step all the

00:20:50.396 --> 00:20:52.296 A:middle
commands that Xcode issued when

00:20:52.296 --> 00:20:54.356 A:middle
it transformed your archive into

00:20:54.356 --> 00:20:57.836 A:middle
an IPA and you get an

00:20:57.836 --> 00:20:59.156 A:middle
ExportOptions.plist.

00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.106 A:middle
So, this last one is kind of

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.106 A:middle
So, this last one is kind of

00:21:02.106 --> 00:21:02.606 A:middle
interesting.

00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:04.976 A:middle
An ExportOptions.plist is like a

00:21:04.976 --> 00:21:06.706 A:middle
recipe, it describes how you

00:21:06.706 --> 00:21:08.236 A:middle
want to transform your archive

00:21:08.556 --> 00:21:09.786 A:middle
into an IPA.

00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:12.176 A:middle
And when you want to automate

00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:13.736 A:middle
the process of generating IPAs

00:21:13.736 --> 00:21:15.136 A:middle
what you do is you invoke

00:21:15.136 --> 00:21:16.496 A:middle
Xcodebuild and give it one of

00:21:16.496 --> 00:21:17.996 A:middle
these ExportOptions.plists.

00:21:18.506 --> 00:21:20.096 A:middle
Now in Xcode 9 it's really easy

00:21:20.096 --> 00:21:21.436 A:middle
to create these because the

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:22.766 A:middle
distribution workflow will

00:21:22.766 --> 00:21:24.236 A:middle
generate one for you so you

00:21:24.236 --> 00:21:25.436 A:middle
don't need to manually edit

00:21:25.436 --> 00:21:26.426 A:middle
these plists anymore.

00:21:27.706 --> 00:21:28.686 A:middle
Here's an example of what one

00:21:28.686 --> 00:21:29.166 A:middle
looks like.

00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:30.946 A:middle
This is a really simple

00:21:30.946 --> 00:21:32.326 A:middle
ExportOptions.plist, as you can

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:34.386 A:middle
see I've set up automatic

00:21:34.386 --> 00:21:36.096 A:middle
signing and I'm exporting for

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:36.736 A:middle
the App Store.

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:38.906 A:middle
And this last key in their

00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:40.086 A:middle
upload symbols I actually don't

00:21:40.086 --> 00:21:41.016 A:middle
even need to include that

00:21:41.016 --> 00:21:42.296 A:middle
because it defaults to yes.

00:21:42.846 --> 00:21:44.186 A:middle
Now there are a lot of options

00:21:44.296 --> 00:21:45.546 A:middle
that you can specify in these

00:21:45.546 --> 00:21:47.106 A:middle
files, you can invoke

00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:49.636 A:middle
Xcodebuild-help in terminal to

00:21:49.636 --> 00:21:50.626 A:middle
see everything that you can

00:21:50.626 --> 00:21:51.186 A:middle
include in an

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:52.166 A:middle
ExportOptions.plist.

00:21:52.486 --> 00:21:53.526 A:middle
But most of the options have

00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:54.496 A:middle
sensible defaults.

00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:57.056 A:middle
When you're ready to use this,

00:21:57.056 --> 00:21:57.996 A:middle
all you do is invoke

00:21:57.996 --> 00:22:00.516 A:middle
Xcodebuild-exportArchive, pass

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.996 --> 00:22:00.516 A:middle
Xcodebuild-exportArchive, pass

00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:01.646 A:middle
the path to your archive and the

00:22:01.676 --> 00:22:03.396 A:middle
path to your ExportOptions.plist

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:05.426 A:middle
and Xcodebuild will generate an

00:22:05.596 --> 00:22:06.246 A:middle
IPA for you.

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:09.096 A:middle
Now there's one other thing, as

00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:10.056 A:middle
you'll recall from Chris'

00:22:10.056 --> 00:22:12.106 A:middle
section, we've added a new flag

00:22:12.106 --> 00:22:13.146 A:middle
to Xcodebuild called

00:22:13.146 --> 00:22:14.996 A:middle
allowProvisioningUpdates and you

00:22:14.996 --> 00:22:16.586 A:middle
can use that here as well, so

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:17.576 A:middle
that Xcodebuild will

00:22:17.576 --> 00:22:18.776 A:middle
automatically generate

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:20.156 A:middle
distribution provisioning

00:22:20.156 --> 00:22:20.986 A:middle
profiles for you.

00:22:21.376 --> 00:22:22.586 A:middle
Anything that's necessary in

00:22:22.586 --> 00:22:24.636 A:middle
order to generate your IPA.

00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:26.786 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the new

00:22:26.786 --> 00:22:27.946 A:middle
distribution workflow in action.

00:22:36.056 --> 00:22:37.186 A:middle
Okay, so here's our chocolate

00:22:37.186 --> 00:22:38.056 A:middle
chip app which we've been

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:40.166 A:middle
working on for a while and as

00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:41.386 A:middle
you can see, our extensive

00:22:41.386 --> 00:22:43.016 A:middle
two-test suite is passing so now

00:22:43.016 --> 00:22:44.036 A:middle
we're ready to upload it to the

00:22:44.036 --> 00:22:44.506 A:middle
App Store.

00:22:45.286 --> 00:22:46.576 A:middle
I'm going to start that off by

00:22:46.576 --> 00:22:48.896 A:middle
clicking product and creating an

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:49.406 A:middle
archive.

00:22:50.076 --> 00:22:51.766 A:middle
And Xcode is going to do that

00:22:51.766 --> 00:22:53.566 A:middle
release build on my app, bundle

00:22:53.566 --> 00:22:55.386 A:middle
it all up and then show me the

00:22:55.386 --> 00:22:57.046 A:middle
archive once it's completed in

00:22:57.046 --> 00:22:57.946 A:middle
the organizer window.

00:22:59.026 --> 00:23:01.126 A:middle
From here I can easily upload it

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.026 --> 00:23:01.126 A:middle
From here I can easily upload it

00:23:01.126 --> 00:23:02.286 A:middle
to the App Store by clicking

00:23:02.286 --> 00:23:05.046 A:middle
this very shiny enticing blue

00:23:05.046 --> 00:23:05.406 A:middle
button.

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:07.446 A:middle
And when I click that the

00:23:07.446 --> 00:23:08.716 A:middle
distribution workflow will drop

00:23:08.716 --> 00:23:09.046 A:middle
down.

00:23:09.966 --> 00:23:11.686 A:middle
Now Xcode is going to start by

00:23:11.686 --> 00:23:13.046 A:middle
analyzing some of the content in

00:23:13.046 --> 00:23:14.826 A:middle
my archive and that includes how

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:16.426 A:middle
my app was signed, so that's how

00:23:16.516 --> 00:23:17.906 A:middle
Xcode knows which Development

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.846 A:middle
Team I'm using it just reads the

00:23:19.846 --> 00:23:21.256 A:middle
signature of my archived app.

00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:23.866 A:middle
It also determines which options

00:23:23.906 --> 00:23:25.336 A:middle
to show me on the next screen.

00:23:26.066 --> 00:23:27.416 A:middle
This content is going to vary

00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:28.906 A:middle
depending on what's in your

00:23:28.906 --> 00:23:30.266 A:middle
archive, as well as the

00:23:30.266 --> 00:23:31.656 A:middle
distribution method you choose.

00:23:32.056 --> 00:23:33.356 A:middle
So, if I had chosen ad hoc

00:23:33.396 --> 00:23:35.466 A:middle
distribution then I'd see some

00:23:35.466 --> 00:23:36.356 A:middle
different options in here.

00:23:37.476 --> 00:23:38.506 A:middle
So, in this case I have a

00:23:38.506 --> 00:23:40.106 A:middle
bitcode option because my app

00:23:40.106 --> 00:23:42.456 A:middle
contains bitcode, I also have a

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:45.776 A:middle
new Strip Swift Symbols option.

00:23:46.876 --> 00:23:48.446 A:middle
What this is going to do is it

00:23:48.446 --> 00:23:50.326 A:middle
allows the App Store to strip

00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:52.126 A:middle
Swift symbols from the Swift

00:23:52.126 --> 00:23:54.316 A:middle
standard libraries in my app and

00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:55.466 A:middle
that's going to greatly reduce

00:23:55.466 --> 00:23:56.966 A:middle
the download size of my app for

00:23:56.966 --> 00:23:58.206 A:middle
my customers, so I'm going to

00:23:58.206 --> 00:23:58.886 A:middle
leave that on.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:01.376 A:middle
I also have the option to upload

00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:03.266 A:middle
symbols which will allow me to

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:04.566 A:middle
receive symbolicated crash

00:24:04.566 --> 00:24:05.686 A:middle
reports from Apple, so I'll

00:24:05.686 --> 00:24:07.326 A:middle
leave that on as well and click

00:24:07.326 --> 00:24:07.676 A:middle
Next.

00:24:08.776 --> 00:24:09.996 A:middle
The next step is where I can

00:24:09.996 --> 00:24:11.246 A:middle
choose how I want to resign my

00:24:11.246 --> 00:24:11.396 A:middle
app.

00:24:11.396 --> 00:24:13.036 A:middle
I'll talk a little bit more

00:24:13.036 --> 00:24:15.196 A:middle
about manual signing later for

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:16.356 A:middle
now, we'll stick to automatic.

00:24:17.476 --> 00:24:18.656 A:middle
And Xcode is going to start

00:24:18.656 --> 00:24:20.056 A:middle
talking to the developer website

00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:22.576 A:middle
and figuring out how to resign

00:24:22.576 --> 00:24:22.956 A:middle
my app.

00:24:23.556 --> 00:24:24.916 A:middle
The first thing it looks for is

00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:25.896 A:middle
a distribution signing

00:24:25.896 --> 00:24:26.466 A:middle
certificate.

00:24:27.096 --> 00:24:28.396 A:middle
Now in this case, my team hasn't

00:24:28.396 --> 00:24:30.406 A:middle
actually created one yet, so

00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:32.316 A:middle
Xcode tells me about that and

00:24:32.316 --> 00:24:33.726 A:middle
asks me if I want to create one.

00:24:34.446 --> 00:24:35.816 A:middle
So now Xcode won't just create

00:24:35.816 --> 00:24:37.066 A:middle
one behind my back I'm fully

00:24:37.066 --> 00:24:38.226 A:middle
aware that I'll have a

00:24:38.226 --> 00:24:40.136 A:middle
distribution certificate and all

00:24:40.136 --> 00:24:41.256 A:middle
I need to do is give Xcode

00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:42.956 A:middle
permission and click Next and

00:24:42.956 --> 00:24:44.786 A:middle
Xcode will generate it.

00:24:44.786 --> 00:24:46.956 A:middle
After that Xcode will ask me if

00:24:46.956 --> 00:24:48.456 A:middle
I want to export my certificate.

00:24:48.836 --> 00:24:49.916 A:middle
Like I said earlier, this is

00:24:49.916 --> 00:24:51.016 A:middle
really important because these

00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:53.316 A:middle
are team owned assets and there

00:24:53.316 --> 00:24:54.626 A:middle
might be other people on my team

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:55.846 A:middle
who need to also distribution

00:24:55.846 --> 00:24:57.396 A:middle
sign or I might need to

00:24:57.396 --> 00:24:58.786 A:middle
reinstall the certificate later,

00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:00.606 A:middle
so we really recommend exporting

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:00.606 A:middle
so we really recommend exporting

00:25:00.606 --> 00:25:01.786 A:middle
a copy of your certificate.

00:25:02.426 --> 00:25:03.956 A:middle
For now, since this is a demo

00:25:03.956 --> 00:25:04.716 A:middle
I'll click Next.

00:25:05.966 --> 00:25:07.206 A:middle
And now Xcode is going to

00:25:07.206 --> 00:25:08.716 A:middle
continue talking to the portal

00:25:08.956 --> 00:25:10.436 A:middle
generating my distribution

00:25:10.436 --> 00:25:11.516 A:middle
provisioning profiles, I'll

00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:13.806 A:middle
allow code sign to use my newly

00:25:13.806 --> 00:25:14.936 A:middle
created signing certificate

00:25:14.936 --> 00:25:15.936 A:middle
that's how you can tell this is

00:25:15.936 --> 00:25:16.266 A:middle
live.

00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:20.086 A:middle
And once Xcode is done it'll

00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:21.846 A:middle
show me details about the IPA

00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:22.506 A:middle
that it's created.

00:25:23.096 --> 00:25:24.826 A:middle
I can see all the content in my

00:25:24.826 --> 00:25:26.946 A:middle
IPA including my framework, my

00:25:26.946 --> 00:25:28.426 A:middle
app extension, and my launch app

00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:29.566 A:middle
right in here.

00:25:29.566 --> 00:25:31.296 A:middle
I can see how they're signed and

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.136 A:middle
I can double-check that the

00:25:32.136 --> 00:25:33.226 A:middle
entitlements are correct.

00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:34.976 A:middle
So, this gives me a chance to

00:25:34.976 --> 00:25:37.016 A:middle
make sure my app is all correct

00:25:37.016 --> 00:25:38.966 A:middle
before I upload it to the App

00:25:38.966 --> 00:25:39.216 A:middle
Store.

00:25:40.376 --> 00:25:41.976 A:middle
Once I'm sure it looks fine I'll

00:25:41.976 --> 00:25:43.546 A:middle
click Upload and Xcode will

00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:44.786 A:middle
upload my app to the Store.

00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:47.536 A:middle
Now in the past once this

00:25:47.536 --> 00:25:49.136 A:middle
completes this is where the

00:25:49.136 --> 00:25:51.526 A:middle
workflow would end in Xcode, but

00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:52.556 A:middle
now there's one additional thing

00:25:52.556 --> 00:25:54.286 A:middle
I can do here, I can export.

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:58.686 A:middle
So, when I select Export and

00:25:58.686 --> 00:26:02.046 A:middle
save to the desktop Xcode will

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.686 --> 00:26:02.046 A:middle
save to the desktop Xcode will

00:26:02.046 --> 00:26:03.276 A:middle
generate a new directory

00:26:03.776 --> 00:26:07.406 A:middle
containing my IPA, as well as

00:26:07.406 --> 00:26:08.506 A:middle
all of those other files,

00:26:08.506 --> 00:26:10.086 A:middle
including an ExportOptions.plist

00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:11.046 A:middle
that I mentioned earlier.

00:26:11.206 --> 00:26:14.876 A:middle
So that's the new distribution

00:26:14.926 --> 00:26:16.836 A:middle
workflow using automatic signing

00:26:16.836 --> 00:26:17.576 A:middle
in Xcode 9.

00:26:18.736 --> 00:26:20.566 A:middle
Now let's talk a little bit

00:26:21.106 --> 00:26:23.596 A:middle
about manual signing.

00:26:23.696 --> 00:26:25.416 A:middle
Manual signing also works just

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:26.436 A:middle
like during development.

00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:28.636 A:middle
You or someone on your team will

00:26:28.636 --> 00:26:30.386 A:middle
create provisioning profiles and

00:26:30.696 --> 00:26:32.466 A:middle
then you can select them in the

00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:33.896 A:middle
Xcode distribution workflow.

00:26:35.076 --> 00:26:36.506 A:middle
Xcode won't ever create or

00:26:36.506 --> 00:26:38.366 A:middle
modify any of these manual

00:26:38.366 --> 00:26:39.596 A:middle
profiles so you're in full

00:26:39.596 --> 00:26:40.056 A:middle
control.

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:43.346 A:middle
This is fully compatible with

00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:44.966 A:middle
Xcodebuild so you can still

00:26:44.966 --> 00:26:46.726 A:middle
automate the creation of your

00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:48.066 A:middle
IPAs if you want use manual

00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:48.436 A:middle
signing.

00:26:48.756 --> 00:26:50.246 A:middle
But there's one note, if your

00:26:50.246 --> 00:26:51.706 A:middle
archive was manually signed when

00:26:51.706 --> 00:26:53.186 A:middle
you built it then you also need

00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:54.206 A:middle
to manually sign when you

00:26:54.206 --> 00:26:54.766 A:middle
distribute.

00:26:55.656 --> 00:26:56.956 A:middle
So, how do you use manual

00:26:56.956 --> 00:26:57.376 A:middle
signing?

00:26:58.896 --> 00:27:00.416 A:middle
You'll recall this screen for my

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:58.896 --> 00:27:00.416 A:middle
You'll recall this screen for my

00:27:00.416 --> 00:27:02.126 A:middle
demo moment ago, if you choose

00:27:02.126 --> 00:27:04.816 A:middle
manual signing click Next, then

00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:05.716 A:middle
you'll be greeted with this

00:27:05.716 --> 00:27:06.226 A:middle
interface.

00:27:06.706 --> 00:27:08.066 A:middle
This is really similar to the

00:27:08.066 --> 00:27:09.866 A:middle
signing UI that you see in the

00:27:09.866 --> 00:27:11.406 A:middle
general tab in Xcode's project

00:27:11.406 --> 00:27:11.776 A:middle
editor.

00:27:12.446 --> 00:27:13.606 A:middle
You can select the distribution

00:27:13.606 --> 00:27:15.246 A:middle
certificate you want to use and

00:27:15.246 --> 00:27:17.006 A:middle
then profiles for each of the

00:27:17.006 --> 00:27:19.036 A:middle
items in your app.

00:27:19.296 --> 00:27:20.526 A:middle
When you pop open those pop-up

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:22.546 A:middle
menus you see the profiles that

00:27:22.546 --> 00:27:24.156 A:middle
are eligible, ineligible, you

00:27:24.156 --> 00:27:25.876 A:middle
can import profiles or download

00:27:25.876 --> 00:27:27.446 A:middle
profiles from the portal

00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:29.056 A:middle
directly within the distribution

00:27:29.056 --> 00:27:29.506 A:middle
workflow.

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:31.956 A:middle
And if you select an ineligible

00:27:31.956 --> 00:27:33.526 A:middle
profile you'll see issues

00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:35.016 A:middle
associated with that selection

00:27:35.296 --> 00:27:36.596 A:middle
right underneath your selection.

00:27:37.636 --> 00:27:38.866 A:middle
Once you've selected valid

00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:40.146 A:middle
profiles for everything in your

00:27:40.146 --> 00:27:41.296 A:middle
app you can click Next and

00:27:41.296 --> 00:27:42.366 A:middle
continue with the workflow.

00:27:42.936 --> 00:27:46.006 A:middle
And as I said, this is all fully

00:27:46.006 --> 00:27:48.216 A:middle
compatible with Xcodebuild all

00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:49.396 A:middle
you need to do is specify a

00:27:49.436 --> 00:27:50.946 A:middle
couple of additional keys in

00:27:50.946 --> 00:27:52.176 A:middle
your ExportOptions.plist.

00:27:52.746 --> 00:27:54.166 A:middle
So, you can see here I set

00:27:54.166 --> 00:27:56.856 A:middle
signing style to manual and I've

00:27:56.856 --> 00:27:58.576 A:middle
also provided a provisioning

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
profiles entry that lists all

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.406 A:middle
profiles entry that lists all

00:28:00.406 --> 00:28:02.106 A:middle
the items in my app by bundle

00:28:02.106 --> 00:28:03.766 A:middle
identifier and all the profiles

00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:04.326 A:middle
I want to use.

00:28:04.756 --> 00:28:06.456 A:middle
And that's it now I'm set up for

00:28:06.456 --> 00:28:07.066 A:middle
automation.

00:28:07.616 --> 00:28:10.286 A:middle
So that's the new distribution

00:28:10.286 --> 00:28:11.936 A:middle
workflow in Xcode 9, we think

00:28:11.936 --> 00:28:13.346 A:middle
you're all really going to love

00:28:13.346 --> 00:28:13.416 A:middle
it.

00:28:13.416 --> 00:28:14.776 A:middle
And now I'd like to invite Brent

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:15.926 A:middle
on stage to talk about

00:28:15.926 --> 00:28:17.416 A:middle
distribution signing in Xcode

00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:17.786 A:middle
Server.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:23.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:24.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you everyone, I'm

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:26.216 A:middle
really excited to be here today

00:28:26.306 --> 00:28:28.016 A:middle
because for the first time in

00:28:28.016 --> 00:28:29.466 A:middle
public we're going to show you

00:28:29.466 --> 00:28:31.056 A:middle
how you can use in Xcode Server

00:28:31.656 --> 00:28:33.156 A:middle
to automatically create

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:35.196 A:middle
distribution signed IPAs for

00:28:35.196 --> 00:28:35.356 A:middle
you.

00:28:35.356 --> 00:28:36.746 A:middle
This is really exciting, it's a

00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:38.146 A:middle
missing piece of the puzzle, and

00:28:38.146 --> 00:28:39.916 A:middle
we finally delivered it and it's

00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:40.376 A:middle
really great.

00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:43.186 A:middle
But first, how did we do this?

00:28:43.926 --> 00:28:45.766 A:middle
Well in Xcode 8 and Xcode 9 we

00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:47.396 A:middle
introduced great automatic

00:28:47.446 --> 00:28:49.186 A:middle
signing workflows in Xcode and

00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:50.606 A:middle
Xcode Server gets all of that

00:28:50.656 --> 00:28:51.226 A:middle
for free.

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.246 A:middle
Likewise, all of the

00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:55.016 A:middle
distribution workflows and the

00:28:55.116 --> 00:28:56.956 A:middle
underlying technology Xcode

00:28:56.956 --> 00:28:58.386 A:middle
Server also gets that from

00:28:58.386 --> 00:28:58.766 A:middle
Xcode.

00:28:59.136 --> 00:29:00.616 A:middle
So, we have automatic signing,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.136 --> 00:29:00.616 A:middle
So, we have automatic signing,

00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:02.236 A:middle
we have distribution, we have

00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:03.746 A:middle
Xcode Server, we have great

00:29:03.746 --> 00:29:05.406 A:middle
workflows for development and

00:29:05.406 --> 00:29:06.276 A:middle
distribution signing.

00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:10.036 A:middle
How does this all work?

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:11.966 A:middle
So, Chris showed a slide that

00:29:11.966 --> 00:29:13.276 A:middle
looked a little bit like this

00:29:13.616 --> 00:29:14.836 A:middle
and it's important to understand

00:29:14.946 --> 00:29:16.686 A:middle
how Xcode Server does this job.

00:29:16.686 --> 00:29:19.056 A:middle
In order to create -- in order

00:29:19.056 --> 00:29:21.706 A:middle
to sign an archive to create an

00:29:21.766 --> 00:29:23.166 A:middle
IPA from it for distribution

00:29:23.586 --> 00:29:24.966 A:middle
Xcode Server needs some special

00:29:24.966 --> 00:29:26.306 A:middle
assets just like for

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:27.816 A:middle
development, it needs signing

00:29:27.816 --> 00:29:29.126 A:middle
certificates and it needs

00:29:29.216 --> 00:29:30.196 A:middle
provisioning profiles.

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:32.496 A:middle
Now fortunately, we've made this

00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:33.056 A:middle
very easy.

00:29:33.616 --> 00:29:34.976 A:middle
If you allow Xcode Server to

00:29:34.976 --> 00:29:36.306 A:middle
communicate with the developer

00:29:36.306 --> 00:29:39.086 A:middle
portal on your behalf it can get

00:29:39.086 --> 00:29:40.226 A:middle
most of these things for you.

00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:40.986 A:middle
It can get the provisioning

00:29:40.986 --> 00:29:42.426 A:middle
profiles automatically.

00:29:43.276 --> 00:29:44.276 A:middle
But there's one thing it can't

00:29:44.276 --> 00:29:45.786 A:middle
get and that's the distribution

00:29:45.986 --> 00:29:46.766 A:middle
signing certificate.

00:29:47.496 --> 00:29:48.246 A:middle
That's really no big deal

00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:49.346 A:middle
because we've provided a great

00:29:49.346 --> 00:29:50.636 A:middle
experience for you to share this

00:29:50.636 --> 00:29:51.266 A:middle
with your server.

00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:54.066 A:middle
So, once your Xcode server has

00:29:54.066 --> 00:29:55.836 A:middle
all of these assets it can build

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:56.786 A:middle
an archive and then it can

00:29:56.786 --> 00:29:59.046 A:middle
transform that archive into an

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:02.096 A:middle
IPA for distribution to the App

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:02.096 A:middle
IPA for distribution to the App

00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:02.366 A:middle
Store.

00:30:05.496 --> 00:30:07.756 A:middle
So, what do you need to do?

00:30:08.356 --> 00:30:09.486 A:middle
You need to copy distribution

00:30:09.486 --> 00:30:11.376 A:middle
certificates to the server, you

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:13.166 A:middle
need to make sure that automatic

00:30:13.226 --> 00:30:14.846 A:middle
signing is turned on so this

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:15.886 A:middle
will also work for manual and

00:30:15.886 --> 00:30:16.456 A:middle
I'll show you that.

00:30:17.046 --> 00:30:18.096 A:middle
And then thirdly, there's this

00:30:18.096 --> 00:30:19.866 A:middle
ExportOptions.plist that Itai

00:30:19.866 --> 00:30:21.476 A:middle
talked to you about, so what's

00:30:21.476 --> 00:30:22.926 A:middle
that all about.

00:30:22.926 --> 00:30:24.376 A:middle
Well the ExportOptions.plist is

00:30:24.376 --> 00:30:26.136 A:middle
just a simple recipe for how you

00:30:26.136 --> 00:30:27.916 A:middle
want Xcode Server to transform

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:29.616 A:middle
your archive into an IPA.

00:30:29.946 --> 00:30:31.096 A:middle
That can be very simple and it

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:32.816 A:middle
can also scale up to some more

00:30:32.996 --> 00:30:35.476 A:middle
complex manual signing scenarios

00:30:35.476 --> 00:30:35.646 A:middle
too.

00:30:37.176 --> 00:30:38.166 A:middle
So, I've been saying App Store a

00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:39.606 A:middle
lot, but I want to emphasize

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.686 A:middle
that what we've built here lets

00:30:41.686 --> 00:30:43.956 A:middle
you distribute for all the

00:30:43.956 --> 00:30:44.886 A:middle
distribution methods, so if

00:30:44.886 --> 00:30:46.336 A:middle
you're doing enterprise or ad

00:30:46.336 --> 00:30:47.626 A:middle
hoc or App Store or whatever

00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:49.066 A:middle
this will just work, so we think

00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:49.656 A:middle
that's really great.

00:30:50.966 --> 00:30:51.896 A:middle
So, let's see this in action.

00:30:59.046 --> 00:31:00.346 A:middle
So, here's our chocolate chip

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.046 --> 00:31:00.346 A:middle
So, here's our chocolate chip

00:31:00.346 --> 00:31:01.576 A:middle
bot that's been dutifully

00:31:01.576 --> 00:31:03.786 A:middle
building our app and running

00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:05.286 A:middle
tests on devices for a few

00:31:05.286 --> 00:31:05.766 A:middle
months now.

00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:07.476 A:middle
So, what I want to do is I want

00:31:07.476 --> 00:31:09.866 A:middle
to repurpose this bot to build

00:31:10.466 --> 00:31:11.466 A:middle
IPAs for me.

00:31:11.916 --> 00:31:13.486 A:middle
Now we recommend as a best

00:31:13.486 --> 00:31:14.366 A:middle
practice that you create a

00:31:14.366 --> 00:31:16.086 A:middle
dedicated bot for this purpose

00:31:16.146 --> 00:31:17.876 A:middle
for creating IPAs, but I'm just

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:19.286 A:middle
going to repurpose this one for

00:31:19.286 --> 00:31:20.446 A:middle
demo purposes today.

00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:22.446 A:middle
So, we'll go and edit the bot.

00:31:22.446 --> 00:31:23.736 A:middle
There are a lot of options in

00:31:23.736 --> 00:31:25.006 A:middle
the bot editor, but what we need

00:31:25.006 --> 00:31:26.196 A:middle
to do today is pretty simple.

00:31:26.716 --> 00:31:27.926 A:middle
First, we're going to visit the

00:31:27.926 --> 00:31:29.996 A:middle
configuration tab and in here

00:31:30.076 --> 00:31:30.916 A:middle
we're going to turn on

00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:31.536 A:middle
archiving.

00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:33.816 A:middle
Remember since Xcode 5 when we

00:31:33.816 --> 00:31:35.396 A:middle
introduced Xcode Server it's

00:31:35.396 --> 00:31:36.956 A:middle
been able to create archives for

00:31:36.956 --> 00:31:38.036 A:middle
you and there have been a lot of

00:31:38.036 --> 00:31:39.136 A:middle
great workflows there.

00:31:39.496 --> 00:31:40.536 A:middle
For example, you can create

00:31:40.536 --> 00:31:42.096 A:middle
archives and then do over the

00:31:42.096 --> 00:31:43.666 A:middle
air installs with Xcode Server

00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:44.586 A:middle
and that's been great.

00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:45.666 A:middle
You can still do that.

00:31:45.876 --> 00:31:47.726 A:middle
But there's one new option that

00:31:47.726 --> 00:31:49.506 A:middle
we've added here and that's what

00:31:49.506 --> 00:31:51.536 A:middle
enables Xcode Server to create

00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:53.756 A:middle
this distribution signed IPA for

00:31:53.756 --> 00:31:53.966 A:middle
you.

00:31:54.466 --> 00:31:55.416 A:middle
So, that's the final option

00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:56.596 A:middle
here, use custom

00:31:56.596 --> 00:31:58.606 A:middle
ExportOptions.plist, well where

00:31:58.606 --> 00:31:59.516 A:middle
do I get one of those?

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:00.496 --> 00:32:01.896 A:middle
Itai being the great guy that he

00:32:01.896 --> 00:32:04.386 A:middle
is you may remember he exported

00:32:04.386 --> 00:32:06.446 A:middle
that for me after he upload his

00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:07.676 A:middle
app to the App Store.

00:32:08.146 --> 00:32:09.736 A:middle
So, I'll go and I'll select that

00:32:09.736 --> 00:32:09.916 A:middle
now.

00:32:10.416 --> 00:32:12.346 A:middle
So, it's a good idea at this

00:32:12.346 --> 00:32:13.876 A:middle
point that you verify that this

00:32:13.876 --> 00:32:15.276 A:middle
is the right ExportOptions.plist

00:32:15.276 --> 00:32:17.076 A:middle
so conveniently you can just

00:32:17.076 --> 00:32:17.436 A:middle
click it.

00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:19.716 A:middle
This is a pretty simple example

00:32:19.916 --> 00:32:21.996 A:middle
of an ExportOptions.plist, but

00:32:21.996 --> 00:32:23.016 A:middle
you may remember from one of

00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:24.666 A:middle
Itai's slides if you're doing --

00:32:25.066 --> 00:32:26.416 A:middle
if you some more complex manual

00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:28.646 A:middle
workflows you would end up

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:30.446 A:middle
perhaps having specific

00:32:30.446 --> 00:32:32.366 A:middle
provisioning profiles here and

00:32:32.456 --> 00:32:33.366 A:middle
other things you can do so

00:32:33.366 --> 00:32:34.666 A:middle
that's a good idea, just verify

00:32:34.666 --> 00:32:35.316 A:middle
that this is the right

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:36.426 A:middle
ExportOptions.plist.

00:32:36.966 --> 00:32:39.066 A:middle
So, we've done that and that's

00:32:39.066 --> 00:32:40.186 A:middle
it for the configuration tab.

00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:42.096 A:middle
Let's visit the signing tab.

00:32:43.406 --> 00:32:44.956 A:middle
So, this is brand new in Xcode 9

00:32:44.956 --> 00:32:45.946 A:middle
and we're pretty excited because

00:32:45.946 --> 00:32:47.966 A:middle
this is how you configure Xcode

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.366 A:middle
Server to do both development

00:32:49.366 --> 00:32:50.346 A:middle
signing and distribution

00:32:50.346 --> 00:32:50.676 A:middle
signing.

00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:53.656 A:middle
So, these two checkboxes at the

00:32:53.656 --> 00:32:55.136 A:middle
top Chris already checked for us

00:32:55.386 --> 00:32:56.696 A:middle
and remember the top one lets

00:32:56.696 --> 00:32:57.966 A:middle
Xcode Server communicate with

00:32:57.966 --> 00:32:59.466 A:middle
the developer website on my

00:32:59.466 --> 00:32:59.976 A:middle
behalf.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.376 --> 00:33:01.556 A:middle
My team is already added to the

00:33:01.556 --> 00:33:03.476 A:middle
server and even if you have a

00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:04.906 A:middle
manual distribution workflow

00:33:05.226 --> 00:33:06.576 A:middle
it's a really good idea that you

00:33:06.576 --> 00:33:07.586 A:middle
still have this checkbox

00:33:07.746 --> 00:33:07.926 A:middle
checked.

00:33:08.356 --> 00:33:10.166 A:middle
So, now let's visit the

00:33:10.166 --> 00:33:11.666 A:middle
certificates and profiles tab,

00:33:12.306 --> 00:33:12.886 A:middle
so what's in here.

00:33:13.386 --> 00:33:15.046 A:middle
There are two tables at the top,

00:33:15.586 --> 00:33:16.776 A:middle
it shows me all the certificates

00:33:16.776 --> 00:33:17.586 A:middle
that are installed on this

00:33:17.586 --> 00:33:19.066 A:middle
machine, at the bottom are the

00:33:19.066 --> 00:33:19.996 A:middle
provisioning profiles.

00:33:20.526 --> 00:33:21.596 A:middle
And what I need to do is I need

00:33:21.596 --> 00:33:23.186 A:middle
to share the distribution

00:33:23.186 --> 00:33:24.376 A:middle
certificate with my server and

00:33:24.816 --> 00:33:26.186 A:middle
that's really easy just click

00:33:26.186 --> 00:33:27.686 A:middle
Add to Server and it's done.

00:33:27.896 --> 00:33:29.106 A:middle
That's all I need to do and now

00:33:29.106 --> 00:33:30.846 A:middle
Xcode Server has access to that

00:33:30.846 --> 00:33:32.416 A:middle
distribution certificate and

00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:33.596 A:middle
because I've allowed it to talk

00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:34.846 A:middle
to the developer website on my

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.946 A:middle
behalf it can get all the assets

00:33:36.946 --> 00:33:38.626 A:middle
it needs to create that IPA.

00:33:38.946 --> 00:33:41.396 A:middle
You may be wondering what I need

00:33:41.396 --> 00:33:42.516 A:middle
to do with the provisioning

00:33:42.606 --> 00:33:43.236 A:middle
profiles table.

00:33:43.236 --> 00:33:44.596 A:middle
Well for most of you if you're

00:33:44.596 --> 00:33:46.396 A:middle
doing automatic code signing and

00:33:46.396 --> 00:33:47.046 A:middle
you're doing App Store

00:33:47.046 --> 00:33:48.336 A:middle
distribution you don't need to

00:33:48.336 --> 00:33:48.866 A:middle
do anything.

00:33:49.326 --> 00:33:50.766 A:middle
But if you're targeting one of

00:33:50.766 --> 00:33:52.256 A:middle
those other distribution methods

00:33:52.846 --> 00:33:54.456 A:middle
or you've specified particular

00:33:54.456 --> 00:33:55.396 A:middle
profiles in that

00:33:55.396 --> 00:33:56.726 A:middle
ExportOptions.plist that we

00:33:56.726 --> 00:33:58.266 A:middle
looked at, you're on the hook

00:33:58.396 --> 00:33:59.686 A:middle
for making sure your server has

00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.876 A:middle
those provisioning profiles.

WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.876 A:middle
those provisioning profiles.

00:34:01.306 --> 00:34:02.826 A:middle
Again, that's really easy, any

00:34:02.826 --> 00:34:04.116 A:middle
profile you want to share you

00:34:04.116 --> 00:34:05.196 A:middle
just click Add to Server and

00:34:05.196 --> 00:34:06.366 A:middle
that will share it with your

00:34:06.366 --> 00:34:06.916 A:middle
Xcode Server.

00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:09.266 A:middle
So that's it, I visited the

00:34:09.266 --> 00:34:10.315 A:middle
signing tab and the

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:11.216 A:middle
configuration tab.

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:12.806 A:middle
And now this is the moment

00:34:12.806 --> 00:34:13.536 A:middle
you've been waiting for.

00:34:13.906 --> 00:34:15.326 A:middle
Let's integrate this bot and

00:34:15.356 --> 00:34:17.206 A:middle
watch it create two things, it's

00:34:17.206 --> 00:34:18.255 A:middle
going to create an archive and

00:34:18.505 --> 00:34:19.436 A:middle
then it's going to transform

00:34:19.436 --> 00:34:22.255 A:middle
that archive into a distribution

00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:23.786 A:middle
signed IPA that I can then

00:34:23.786 --> 00:34:24.916 A:middle
upload to the App Store.

00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:31.446 A:middle
And there it is.

00:34:31.446 --> 00:34:32.706 A:middle
So, for the first time we think

00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:34.096 A:middle
this is a really exciting

00:34:34.096 --> 00:34:35.766 A:middle
development in Xcode Server and

00:34:35.886 --> 00:34:37.186 A:middle
it's going to save you a lot of

00:34:37.846 --> 00:34:37.966 A:middle
time.

00:34:38.516 --> 00:34:45.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:45.656 --> 00:34:47.085 A:middle
So, code signing, code signing

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:48.866 A:middle
is really important and we

00:34:48.866 --> 00:34:49.786 A:middle
should feel fortunate as

00:34:49.786 --> 00:34:51.485 A:middle
developers and users that we're

00:34:51.485 --> 00:34:52.676 A:middle
using platforms where code

00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:54.585 A:middle
signing is an integral part of

00:34:54.585 --> 00:34:55.206 A:middle
the experience.

00:34:56.016 --> 00:34:57.866 A:middle
It keeps us safe, it keeps us

00:34:57.866 --> 00:34:59.546 A:middle
secure, we know it's hard to get

00:34:59.546 --> 00:34:59.806 A:middle
right.

00:35:00.166 --> 00:35:02.336 A:middle
But in Xcode 8 and Xcode 9 we've

00:35:02.336 --> 00:35:04.176 A:middle
put a ton of work into providing

00:35:04.176 --> 00:35:05.466 A:middle
really great solutions for you

00:35:05.466 --> 00:35:06.696 A:middle
and we think it's easier than

00:35:06.696 --> 00:35:06.946 A:middle
ever.

00:35:07.646 --> 00:35:09.026 A:middle
So, we have development signing

00:35:09.026 --> 00:35:10.316 A:middle
with Xcode Server for your

00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:11.656 A:middle
day-to-day development and

00:35:11.656 --> 00:35:12.566 A:middle
testing on devices.

00:35:14.126 --> 00:35:15.296 A:middle
We've also done a lot of work

00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:16.426 A:middle
for manual signing because we

00:35:16.426 --> 00:35:17.366 A:middle
know that's important to a lot

00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:17.616 A:middle
of you.

00:35:17.776 --> 00:35:20.946 A:middle
We made big improvements to the

00:35:20.946 --> 00:35:22.446 A:middle
distribution workflow in Xcode

00:35:22.786 --> 00:35:24.036 A:middle
and of course, we've brought

00:35:24.036 --> 00:35:25.576 A:middle
that distribution workflow to

00:35:25.576 --> 00:35:26.256 A:middle
Xcode Server.

00:35:27.366 --> 00:35:29.466 A:middle
So that's it, there are a lot

00:35:29.466 --> 00:35:30.976 A:middle
more related sessions this week

00:35:30.976 --> 00:35:31.906 A:middle
on this topic.

00:35:32.256 --> 00:35:33.546 A:middle
Thanks for attending and have a

00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:33.946 A:middle
great week.
